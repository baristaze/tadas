# ops-watch

A live tail with a cap. The skill polls the logs of one environment
once per interval, reads the alarms every interval, and reports in
batches. It is written to be run by a sub-agent: the invoking session
spawns one with this skill's text and the arguments, and reads the
report when the agent returns. A session that runs it inline waits
for the whole window.

No command follows a stream. A command that never returns runs into
the shell's time cap, which ends the call and loses the batch. So
every read is a bounded query over one closed interval, and the wait
between two is a `sleep` of the interval, which is capped well under
the time cap.

Read `.claude/skills/_shared/ops-preamble.md` before the first step:
the profiles, the account check, and the env file are there.

## Input

`--env local|staging|production [--for 15m] [--interval 60s] [--cap 50] [--filter <text>]`

`--env` is required; ask for it when missing. `--for` is the window,
fifteen minutes by default; the skill ends when it passes. `--interval`
is the batch length, at most five minutes, so one wait never nears
the shell's time cap. `--cap` is the most lines one batch reports;
what is over the cap is counted, not printed. `--filter` narrows the
read to lines containing the text (a request id, a route, a level).

Spawn it in a sub-agent. The invoker names the window and reads the
report; the sub-agent does the polling.

`local` reads `docker compose logs` over each interval and the twins;
no cloud is needed.

## Role and credential

`--env local` needs the compose stack with the `devx` profile up
(`make devx-up`) and the env file below. No cloud credential.

`--env staging` and `--env production` run under the investigate
profile of that environment, `tadas-<env>-investigate`, checked with
`sts get-caller-identity` before any other command as the preamble
states. Refuse any profile wider than the investigate role. A chained
session lasts an hour at most, so the watch passes the profile to
every command and never caches a credential: each batch gets a fresh
session from the person's sign-in. When the sign-in itself has ended,
the watch closes its batch, says the session ended, and returns; it
never asks for a sign-in.

The env file `~/.config/tadas/ops/<env>.env` gives the API's URL, the
`read` operator token, and the error tracker's. Never read the env
file; a command that needs a value sources it in the same command, as
every block below does. Never print a token. On a `401` the token has
expired: stop, and name the refresh the preamble gives.

When the env file names no tracker, the batches below are unaffected:
they count requests, 5xx, the p95, and the worker failures out of the
account's own metrics, and anything that would have come from the
tracker is reported as "not read", never as "no errors".

## Procedure

1. Verify the credential as Role and credential states. A chained
   session lasts an hour at most, so every interval reads the profile
   again and checks `sts get-caller-identity`; when the person's
   session behind it has ended, the watch stops and says so in its
   report, rather than retrying on a credential that is gone. Note
   the start time; every batch is
   `[start + k * interval, start + (k + 1) * interval)`, read once
   that interval has closed, and no batch is read twice.
2. Read the platform's size once:

   ```bash
   uv run tadas-ops size --env <env>
   ```

   Keep the numbers; the first responder rule of step 6 reads them.
3. Each interval, wait for it to close, then read its lines. The
   wait:

   ```bash
   sleep <interval in seconds>
   ```

   The read, cloud, one query per process (`api` and `maintenance`,
   the log groups `/tadas/<env>/api` and `/tadas/<env>/maintenance`),
   bounded by the batch's start and end in epoch milliseconds, never
   `--follow`:

   ```bash
   aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /tadas/<env>/api \
     --start-time <batch start> --end-time <batch end> \
     --filter-pattern '<filter>' --max-items <cap + 1> \
     --profile tadas-<env>-investigate
   ```

   Local, the same interval, never `-f`:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/local/docker-compose.yml logs \
     --since <batch start, RFC 3339> --until <batch end, RFC 3339>
   ```

   from the repository root (add `-f deployment/local/docker-compose.full.yml`
   when the application runs in containers), together with the lines
   of the interval from the file a host process was started with;
   `scripts/dev.sh` writes no file, it logs to its terminal.
4. Each interval, read the alarms. Cloud:

   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-name-prefix tadas-<env>- \
     --state-value ALARM --profile tadas-<env>-investigate
   ```

   Local: the nine alarm conditions of `ops-investigate` as queries against
   `$TADAS_PROMETHEUS_URL/api/v1/query`. An alarm that was already in
   `ALARM` in the last batch is not reported again; a transition
   (`OK` to `ALARM`, `ALARM` to `OK`) is.
5. Each interval, read one number per signal for that interval and
   nothing more: the request count, the 5xx count, the p95, the
   worker failures, through `get-metric-data` with `--period` equal
   to the interval, or the same as a Prometheus range query. A burst
   is a count in the batch, never a line per event: the batch's lines
   over `--cap` are counted by level and dropped.
6. The first responder rule. In production every alarm transition is
   an escalation. Outside production it is read against the size of
   step 2, and it is suppressed only when the traffic is the team's
   own: one tenant and one user, and that user is the team's. Then the
   alarm is written into the batch as suppressed, with the reason and
   the size, and the watch goes on. Anything else, and the alarm is an
   escalation: the batch is closed early, the report is written
   with the alarm at the top, and the sub-agent returns so the
   invoker can act.
7. When the window passes, write the report with
   every batch in order.

## What it never does

- No write to the cloud, no acknowledgement or silence of an alarm,
  no change to a log group.
- No secret value printed, no line printed that carries one (a line
  with a bearer or a password field is reported as its count).
- No tenant data outside the signals: the logs carry ids, never rows.
- No `terraform apply`, no console clicks.
- No unbounded output: never more than `--cap` lines per batch, never
  the same window twice, never a read past `--for`.
- No command that does not return: no `--follow`, no `-f`, no wait
  longer than one interval.

## Output

```markdown
# Watch: <env>, <start> to <end>, every <interval>

**Credential.** <profile and the Arn it resolved to, or local>
**Size.** <tenants> tenants, <users> users, <n> written in the last day
**Ended.** <window passed | escalated on <alarm> at <time>>

## Alarms

- <time> <alarm name>: <OK to ALARM | ALARM to OK>, <suppressed: reason | escalated>

## Batches

- <start of batch>: <requests> requests, <5xx> 5xx, p95 <ms>, <failures> worker failures; <lines> lines shown, <dropped> over the cap (<by level>)
  - <line>
  - <line>

## Findings

- <what moved, one sentence, with the request id that proves it>

## Next
