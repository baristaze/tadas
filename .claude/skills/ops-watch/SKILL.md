# ops-watch

A live tail with a cap. The skill opens the log stream of one
environment, reads the alarms every interval, and reports in batches.
It is written to be run by a sub-agent: the invoking session spawns
one with this skill's text and the arguments, and reads the report
when the agent returns. A session that runs it inline blocks on the
tail for the whole window.

## Input

`--env local|staging|production [--for 15m] [--interval 60s] [--cap 50] [--filter <text>]`

`--env` is required; ask for it when missing. `--for` is the window,
fifteen minutes by default; the skill ends when it passes. `--interval`
is the batch length. `--cap` is the most lines one batch reports;
what is over the cap is counted, not printed. `--filter` narrows the
tail to lines containing the text (a request id, a route, a level).

Spawn it in a sub-agent. The invoker names the window and reads the
report; the sub-agent holds the tail.

`local` tails `docker compose logs -f` and reads the twins; no cloud
is needed.

## Role and credential

`--env local` needs the compose stack with the `devx` profile up
(`make devx-up`) and the env file below. No cloud credential.

`--env staging` and `--env production` need the investigate profile
of that environment, `tadas-<env>-investigate`, which assumes the role
`tadas-investigate-<env>`. Before any other command, run

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile tadas-<env>-investigate
```

and check that `Arn` reads
`arn:aws:sts::<account>:assumed-role/tadas-investigate-<env>/...`.
Refuse any other identity, the administrator profile `tadas-admin`
above all. Every `aws` command below carries
`--profile tadas-<env>-investigate`.

The env file `~/.config/tadas/ops/<env>.env` is owner-only and outside
the repository. It holds `TADAS_API_URL`, `TADAS_OPERATOR_EMAIL`,
`TADAS_OPERATOR_PASSWORD`, `TADAS_ERROR_TRACKER_URL`, and
`TADAS_ERROR_TRACKER_TOKEN`; `local.env` adds `TADAS_PROMETHEUS_URL` and
`TADAS_JAEGER_URL`. Never print the password or the token.

## Procedure

1. Verify the credential as Role and credential states. Read the env
   file. Note the start time; every batch is `[start + k * interval,
   start + (k + 1) * interval)`, and no batch is read twice.
2. Read the platform's size once:

   ```bash
   uv run tadas-ops size --env <env>
   ```

   Keep the numbers; the first responder rule of step 6 reads them.
3. Open the tail. Cloud:

   ```bash
   aws logs tail /tadas/<env>/api --follow --since <interval> \
     --format short --filter-pattern '<filter>' \
     --profile tadas-<env>-investigate
   ```

   One tail per process the watch covers (`api`, `maintenance`).
   Local:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deployment/local/docker-compose.yml logs -f \
     --since <interval>
   ```

   together with the host processes' log files `scripts/dev.sh`
   writes, followed with the same cadence.
4. Each interval, read the alarms. Cloud:

   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --alarm-name-prefix tadas-<env>- \
     --state-value ALARM --profile tadas-<env>-investigate
   ```

   Local: the six alarm conditions as queries against
   `$TADAS_PROMETHEUS_URL/api/v1/query`. An alarm that was already in
   `ALARM` in the last batch is not reported again; a transition
   (`OK` to `ALARM`, `ALARM` to `OK`) is.
5. Each interval, read one number per signal for that interval and
   nothing more: the request count, the 5xx count, the p95, the
   worker failures, through `get-metric-data` with `--period` equal
   to the interval, or the same as a Prometheus range query. A burst
   is a count in the batch, never a line per event: the tail's lines
   over `--cap` are counted by level and dropped.
6. The first responder rule. An alarm transition is read against the
   size of step 2. One tenant and one user is the developer: the
   alarm is written into the batch as suppressed, with the reason and
   the size, and the watch goes on. More than that, and the alarm is
   an escalation: the batch is closed early, the report is written
   with the alarm at the top, and the sub-agent returns so the
   invoker can act.
7. When the window passes, close the tails and write the report with
   every batch in order.

## What it never does

- No write to the cloud, no acknowledgement or silence of an alarm,
  no change to a log group.
- No secret value printed, no line printed that carries one (a line
  with a bearer or a password field is reported as its count).
- No tenant data outside the signals: the logs carry ids, never rows.
- No `terraform apply`, no console clicks.
- No unbounded output: never more than `--cap` lines per batch, never
  the same window twice, never a tail past `--for`.

## Output

```markdown
# Watch: <env>, <start> to <end>, every <interval>

**Credential.** <profile and the Arn it resolved to, or local>
**Size.** <tenants> tenants, <users> users, <n> written in the last day
**Ended.** <window passed | escalated on <alarm> at <time>>

## Alarms

- <time> <alarm name>: <OK to ALARM | ALARM to OK>, <suppressed: reason | escalated>

## Batches

- <start of batch>: <requests> requests, <5xx> 5xx, p95 <ms>, <failures> worker failures; <lines> lines shown, <dropped> over the cap (<by level>)
  - <line>
  - <line>

## Findings

- <what moved, one sentence, with the request id that proves it>

## Next

<the skill to run next, with its arguments, or "nothing">
