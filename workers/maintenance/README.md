# The maintenance worker

The background process of Tadas. Every replica runs three things side by
side, started in `main.py`.

- **The work loop** (`loop.py`) claims items from the work queue on its
  lane and runs each under the context the claim built. It renews each
  lease, and completes, fails, parks, or refuses the item. The handlers are
  in `handler.py`, `orchestrations.py`, and `accounts.py`.
- **The delivery consumer** (`deliveries.py`) long-polls `Queues.WEBHOOKS`,
  where the API queues each provider's verified delivery, and applies it
  once in the org it names. A message that can never apply is dropped; any
  other failure comes back.
- **The sweep** (`loop.py`) runs on a timer, within a budget. It requeues
  expired leases, relays the outbox, purges every row past its retention
  (`settings.py`), counts the platform's size, and logs the queue's gauges.

`serve` runs the three; `health` asks the running process's `/healthz`.

## Adding a work kind

Add the kind, its payload, and the permission that asks for it in
`tadas.om.work`. Write a handler that names the permissions it calls with
(`REQUIRES`), and add it to `handlers` in `build_loop`; a test holds the
two to each other. A long-running kind is an `OrchestrationKind` whose step
is mapped in `build_loop`.

## Adding a delivery provider

Implement `DeliveryProviderInterface`: read the delivery, name its org, and
apply it under an id derived from its key, so a copy changes nothing. Add it
to `providers` in `build_consumer`, under the name the API queues it with.
