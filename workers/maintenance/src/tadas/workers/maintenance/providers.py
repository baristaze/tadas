"""A provider's failure, read as the outcome of the work that called it, and
told to every other worker through the outage signal.

Read by status, as every boundary reads an exception. A 503 is "not right
now": a provider out of reach, throttling, not configured here, or
refusing the process's own key. The item parks, spending no attempt, and
waits for the provider, or for a person to fix the key. A provider that
answered and refused the request itself fails the item at once: the same
call gets the same answer (NET-33). Anything else is raised as it is, and
the queue retries it until the attempts are spent.

A 503 is news for every worker that calls the provider with the same
credential, so the call marks the pair out until its wait ends. Each call
reads the mark first: a marked pair parks the item until the mark's retry
time, with no call made. A call that answers clears the mark."""
