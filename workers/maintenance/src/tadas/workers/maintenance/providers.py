"""A provider's failure, read as the outcome of the work that called it.

Read by status, as every boundary reads an exception. A 503 is "not right
now": a provider out of reach, throttling, not configured here, or
refusing the process's own key. The item parks, spending no attempt, and
waits for the provider, or for a person to fix the key. A provider that
answered and refused the request itself fails the item at once: the same
call gets the same answer (NET-33). Anything else is raised as it is, and
the queue retries it until the attempts are spent."""
