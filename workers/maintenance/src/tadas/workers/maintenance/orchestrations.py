"""The handlers of long-running records: one step of a record, and the wake
of the records an event cleared the reason of.

A step reads the record when it runs. A record that is no longer running
(parked, finished, failed) has nothing for the item to do, and the item
completes. What one step of a kind does is the namespace whose rows it
changes, which lands the step's effect and the record's next cursor in one
commit, with the work row of the next step; so a worker that dies leaves the
record at its last committed step, and the item comes back to the queue and
goes on from there.

An error a step raises is the work queue's: the item is retried with a
growing delay, and the retry starts again at the cursor the last commit
left. On the item's last attempt the record fails `defect` instead, so a
record never waits on work that will not come. A guard parks inside the step
itself; only a bound fails."""
