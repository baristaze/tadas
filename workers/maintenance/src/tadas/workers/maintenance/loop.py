        """First the cross-tenant steps that bound recovery: the expired
        leases go back to the queue, and the outbox rows a crash or an outage
        left are relayed. Then the standing chores, in the tenants that one
        read across tenants finds with a chore due, each under its service
        context. Then one service context per tenant, the system scope first
        and deleted tenants included, and under each the purge of a tenant
        past its retention. Then each namespace's purge of its rows past
        their retention, once across every tenant, and the cross-tenant
        purges of the outbox and the queue. Every step is idempotent and
        wrapped, so a failing tenant or step never stops the rest.

        The pass has a budget. The requeue and the relay run on every pass,
        each again while its batch comes back full and the budget lasts, so
        a crashed worker's item waits one pass at most and a backlog drains
        at the pace the budget allows. The chores take a page of the tenants
        with one due a pass (`_run_chores`). The ring of tenants takes no new
        tenant once the budget is spent, but always takes one, and the next
        pass starts at the tenant this one stopped at, so every tenant is
        reached in turn however many there are. A tenant it takes runs every
        purge at least once; a purge whose batch came back full runs again,
        in turn with the others, while the budget lasts. The purges across
        tenants run on every pass, each at least once and again while its
        batch comes back full and the budget lasts. A living tenant with no
        chore due costs a pass no read at all. The three reads of the queue
        and the outbox end every pass, whatever the budget, since the alarms
        read them."""
