"""The consumer of what providers deliver: the other side of the webhook
routes. The API verifies each delivery at the edge and queues it on
`Queues.WEBHOOKS` as `{"idempotency_key", "provider", "delivery"}`. The
consumer receives it, hands the delivery to the provider it names, finds
the org the delivery names, and applies it under that org's service
context.

Every delivery is applied once: what it writes takes an id derived from the
delivery's key, so a copy the queue hands over again changes nothing. A
message is deleted once it is applied, or once it can never be (malformed,
no org, or an org that is gone). Any other failure leaves it to come back
after its visibility, and the queue dead-letters it past its receives. So
does a provider this worker does not know, since a newer one may."""
