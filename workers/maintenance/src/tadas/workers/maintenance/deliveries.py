"""The consumer of the payment processor's deliveries: the other side of
the webhook route. It receives from the inbound queue, finds the org a
delivery names, and applies it under that org's service context. Every
delivery is applied once: its mark lands in the same commit as the account
it changes, so a copy the queue hands over again changes nothing. A message
is deleted once it is applied, or once it can never be (no org, or an org
that is gone); any other failure leaves it to come back after its
visibility, and the queue dead-letters it past its receives."""
