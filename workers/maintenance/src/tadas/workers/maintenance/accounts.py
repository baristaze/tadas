"""The handlers of a deleted account, and of a deleted team org: what one
commit could not do.

The account's own rows go in the request that deleted it, so the person is
gone the moment it answers and nothing below can bring them back. What is
left is outside the database, and the queue carries it to the end.

`DELETE_ACCOUNT` runs in the person's personal org. It deletes the person at
the identity provider, then the org, which the sweep then purges whole.
Each step is one a rerun finds done, so a run that stopped halfway is
finished by the next. A provider that cannot be reached, or that refuses the
process's own key, parks the item, spending no attempt: nothing about the
call has failed, and the work waits for the provider, or a person, to fix
it. A provider that refuses the call itself fails the item at once, since
asking again gets the same answer, and leaves a failed item for an operator
to read and requeue. The org stays until the provider is done: deleted
first, it could no longer run the work that names it.

`DELETE_ORG` runs in a team org its owner or an operator deleted. Its
members and their credentials went in the request, so nobody is in it. It
deletes the org's organization at the identity provider, then the org: the
sweep purges it after the retention. Every step, and every wait and
failure, is the account's (ADR 0042)."""
