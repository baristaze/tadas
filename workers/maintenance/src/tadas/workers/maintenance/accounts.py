"""The handlers of a deleted account, and of a deleted team org: what each
one commit could not do.

The account's own rows go in the request that deleted it, so the person is
gone the moment it answers and nothing below can bring them back. What is
left is outside the database, or in orgs the person no longer holds a place
in, and the queue carries it to the end.

`DELETE_ACCOUNT` runs in the person's personal org. It deletes the person at
the identity provider, ends the org's subscription and deletes its customer
at the payment processor, removes the org's Slack app, and deletes the org
last, which the sweep then purges whole. Every step is one a rerun finds
done, so a run that stopped halfway is finished by the next. A provider that
cannot be reached, or that refuses the process's own key, parks the item,
spending no attempt: nothing about the call has failed, and the work waits
for the provider, or a person, to fix it. A provider that refuses the call
itself fails the item at once, since asking again gets the same answer, and
leaves a failed item for an operator to read and requeue. The org stays
until the providers are done: deleted first, it could no longer run the
work that names it.

`UNASSIGN_TASKS` runs in each org the person left, under their name: their
open tasks there go unassigned, each by the update a person makes to clear
an assignee. It runs on the service role, whatever role the person held:
the unassignment is what an account's deletion does, not a write the
person asks for (ADR 0041).

`DELETE_ORG` runs in a team org its owner or an operator deleted. Its
members and their credentials went in the request, so nobody is in it. It
deletes the org's organization at the identity provider, ends the
subscription and deletes the customer at the payment processor, removes the
Slack app, and deletes the org last: the sweep purges it after the
retention. Every step, and every wait and failure, is the account's
(ADR 0042)."""
