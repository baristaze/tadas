"""What Slack sends, handled after the API acknowledged it.

The API checks each call's signature, answers Slack within its three seconds,
and puts the call on the `slack` queue as a `SlackInbound`; this module is
the other side of that queue. A call is a slash command (`/tadas ...`) or an
event: an app mention, the App Home being opened, the app being uninstalled,
or the bot joining a channel, which mends an installation broken by that
channel. Each is handled here and then deleted from the queue; one whose
handling failed is left there and comes back after its visibility timeout,
and the hosted queue moves it to its dead-letter queue after a few returns.

A call names a workspace, never a tenant: the org is the one that installed
the app in that workspace. A command also names a Slack user, and the person
is the member of that org whose sign-in proved the address the Slack profile
holds. What the command does, it does as that person, with their role.

Handling twice is harmless, which is what makes Slack's retries and the
queue's redeliveries safe. A task `/tadas add` creates takes an id derived
from the call's key and the time it was received (ADR 0027), so the second
create meets the row already there. The reply to a mention is recorded under
the call's key, so it is posted once. The rest are answers to the person who
typed, which say the same thing again, and reads, which change nothing. A
join mends an installation once; a second finds it well."""
