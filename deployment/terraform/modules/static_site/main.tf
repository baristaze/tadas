# serves the exact files staging already served, and reaches the API through
# this same distribution: the API's paths go to its load balancer, so every
# call the page makes is same-origin and no browser sends a preflight. The
# company site (name "site") calls nothing, has one page and a 404 page, and
# carries its environment's links in its build.
