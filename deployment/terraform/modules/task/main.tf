# One one-off task: a task definition that no service keeps running, started
# by `aws ecs run-task` when there is a job to do and stopped when it ends.
# The migration and the operator grant are the two. Each is its own
# definition, with its own roles, so the credentials it carries are its own:
# the migrate task holds the master's and the migration login's URLs, which
# no serving task does, and the grant task holds the one write on the token
# secrets, which nothing else does.
#
# No collector sidecar: a one-off task serves no metrics and sends no
# traces, and the task's exit code is its container's alone.
