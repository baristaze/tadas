# One environment's investigate role: the credential a person or an agent
# assumes to look at that environment, and a credential that can change
# nothing. An agent holding it may read every signal and every resource
# description, and may run `terraform plan -lock=false -refresh=false` on the
# environment root; what it cannot do is write to the cloud, read a tenant's
# data, open the database, or reach the other environment.
#
# Trust is a person signed in through IAM Identity Center: the account's own
# principals, narrowed by a condition to the permission set roles named in
# `operator_principal_arn_patterns`. Those roles carry a generated suffix,
# and a principal element takes no wildcard, so the pattern goes in the
# condition. A person gives an agent this role, never their own.
#
# Permission is ReadOnlyAccess, which reads the whole account, plus the calls
# ReadOnlyAccess leaves out that an investigation needs (Logs Insights
# queries, X-Ray traces, the cost explorer), and then the fences: a deny
# beats every allow, so the wide read is cut back to what the role is for.
