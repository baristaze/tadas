# The default alarm set of one environment, and the one topic they all go
# to: the edge (5xx ratio, unhealthy targets, p95 latency), one per read
# that has a latency of its own to keep (GET /v1/billing), the database
# (CPU, free storage), the queues (a backlog and a dead letter, per
# inbound queue), the worker's sweep (a pass longer than its interval), the
# work queue and the outbox in Postgres (a backlog, a dead letter, the
# relay's lag), and the runtime (a service running fewer tasks than it wants, one per
# service). The thresholds are inputs with defaults here, at the
# leaf, because a threshold is a number and not shape; an environment that
# wants another number passes it through the environment module, which
# exposes none of them yet.
#
# The first responder is an agent holding the investigate role: it reads the
# alarm against the platform's size before it escalates, so the topic's
# subscribers are the people who are told, not the people who act first.
