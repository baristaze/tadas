# The release before, on this branch's schema (ADR 0084). A rollout runs the
# release before beside this one, on this one's schema, and the fast rollback
# returns to it. So a migration the release before cannot run on fails its
# writes for the minutes of the roll, and for good after a rollback.
#
#   scripts/release_before.sh [<base>]    # <base> defaults to origin/main
#
# A branch that changes nothing under om/migrations since its merge base with
# <base> ends here, green, with no database. Otherwise it brings the compose
# stack up, migrates every chain to this branch's head, and runs the
# integration suite of each release before against that schema:
# - the merge base, the release staging runs while this branch rolls out;
# - the tip of origin/release, the release production runs and the fast
#   rollback's target, when that branch exists and is not the merge base.
# Each release is checked out beside this one with its own environment. Each
# role's version record is stamped to that release's head first: its suite
# migrates to its own head, and its chains hold no revision of this branch.
# Its suite reads this branch's .env over its own, so it reaches this stack.
# It runs without its own migration tests, which hold its chain to its ORM and
# fail on any newer schema, and without each test
# scripts/release_before_deselect.txt names. On the way out every record is
# stamped back to this branch's heads, which `make migrate` reads next.
#
# Like `make test-integration`, it empties every table of the local stack.
