#
# Each environment has an AWS account of its own, and
# deployment/cloud/environments.json names it: the account id, the
# administrator profile that bootstraps it, the Identity Center profile an
# operator signs in with, the region, and the environment's three public
# names (the API, the portal, the company site). This script reads
# everything from there and refuses to act in any other account.
#
# What it does, in order: checks the profile is the environment's
# administrator and the account is the environment's, and checks the GitHub
# login; applies the environment's bootstrap root with local state and moves
# that state into the bucket it made; delegates the API's and the portal's
# names from the domain's zone at Cloudflare to the zones the root made;
# writes the company site's records in that zone (its certificate's
# validation record, then, once a deploy has made the site's distribution,
# the site's name as a CNAME to it); writes the
# investigate profile, chained from the Identity Center profile; creates the
# GitHub environments and sets their variables from the root's outputs;
# writes the operator's env file with its two token lines empty; starts the
# first deploy through the pipeline, which is how every later commit reaches
# the cloud; prints the provider steps a person takes after that deploy (the
# Stripe, WorkOS, and Slack values written into the secrets it made); and
# prints the grants that come after them, the first operator's among them,
# which the grant-operator workflow runs. It checks the
# account again before every apply. It prints every command before it runs
# it, and `--dry-run` prints them without running anything.
#
# Staging runs first, then production, then staging again: staging's images
# and portal builds replicate into production's account, and the replication
# needs production's artifacts bucket to exist. The second staging run finds
# it and turns the replication on.
