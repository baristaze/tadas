# command and strips the quotes out of the first. Read it the way
# pydantic-settings and compose do instead: one KEY=VALUE per line, comments
# and blanks skipped, one layer of matching quotes removed, no expansion. The
# file is defaults: a variable the shell exports wins over it, as it does for
# the settings, for compose, and for the Makefile.
