# Destroy an environment, as its account's administrator. The
# `ops-cloud-deployment-nuke` skill narrates this script; the script is the
# hands.
#
#   scripts/cloud_nuke.sh staging [--dry-run]
#   scripts/cloud_nuke.sh production --confirm production [--dry-run]
#
# Staging goes on the word. Production refuses unless three things hold: its
# name is typed after `--confirm`; `environments/prod/main.tf` on
# `origin/release`, the branch production applies, reads
# `database_deletion_protection = false`; and production's state shows that
# release applied. The destruction of production is itself a pull request a
# person read, released like any other.
#
# The run applies from the exact commit the environment runs, in a clean
# worktree of its own: `release` for production, and for staging the commit
# of its last deploy whose apply succeeded, never the tip of `main`. It
# applies the environment root once with `destroyable=true`: buckets
# empty on destroy, and staging's database drops its protection and skips
# its final snapshot. Production's database does neither: its protection is
# off only because a release turned it off, and it keeps its final snapshot
# and its automated backups. Then it destroys the root and prints what
# remains. It prints every command
# before it runs it, and `--dry-run` prints them without running anything.
# The account, the administrator profile, the region, and the public names
# come from deployment/cloud/environments.json, and the account is checked
# before the apply and before the destroy. The bootstrap root stays: the
# account keeps its roles, its registry, its zones, and its state. Nothing
# at the providers is touched either; the list at the end names what stays
# at Stripe, WorkOS, and Slack.
#
# Inputs, as flags or as environment variables:
#   --alarm-email    ALARM_EMAIL       the address the root's alarms go to
