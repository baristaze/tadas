# Scale: one variable turns autoscaling on

Scaling out is a deployment decision, made in one place. Every service
declares its autoscaling, and one variable per environment turns all of
it on. It is off by default, because an unattended scale-out is a bill
nobody approved.

## The flip

In `deployment/terraform/environments/<staging|prod>/main.tf`:

```hcl
  autoscaling_enabled     = false
  api_autoscaling         = { max = 2 }
  maintenance_autoscaling = { max = 1 }
```

A pull request that sets `autoscaling_enabled = true` scales the
environment. Each service's object is on by default, with its ceiling
(`max`) and the CPU it tracks (`target_cpu`, 60 percent). One service
stays out with `enabled = false` in its object. The floor is the
desired count already in the root (`api_desired_count`,
`maintenance_desired_count`), so the flip changes nothing until load
does. The sizes in
[deployment/cloud/README.md](../../deployment/cloud/README.md) name a
database pool that holds at every ceiling.

## What turns on

Per service, in `deployment/terraform/modules/service`:

- a scaling target on the service's desired count, from the floor to the
  ceiling;
- a target-tracking policy, `tadas-<environment>-<service>-cpu`, that
  scales out after a 60-second cooldown and in after 300.

With the flip off, neither exists. The plan of the flip adds two
resources per service and changes nothing else.

The database's storage grows on its own from the first apply
(`max_allocated_storage` is five times the allocation), flip or no
flip: that is a ceiling on how full a disk gets, not a bill that scales
with traffic, and a full disk is an outage.

## An apply returns the count to the floor

`desired_count` stays out of `ignore_changes`, so every apply sets a
scaled service back to its floor, and the policy raises it again within
its cooldown while load lasts
([ADR 0025](../adr/0025-rules-of-0-29-0-that-wait-for-their-feature.md)). An
environment that cannot afford the dip raises its floor in the same pull
request.

## Read that it happened

Under the investigate profile ([operate.md](operate.md)):

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=tadas-staging-investigate
aws application-autoscaling describe-scalable-targets --service-namespace ecs \
  --resource-ids service/tadas-staging/api service/tadas-staging/maintenance \
  --query 'ScalableTargets[].{service:ResourceId,min:MinCapacity,max:MaxCapacity}' --output table
aws application-autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --service-namespace ecs \
  --resource-id service/tadas-staging/api --max-results 10 \
  --query 'ScalingActivities[].{at:StartTime,what:Description,why:Cause}' --output table
aws ecs describe-services --cluster tadas-staging --services api \
  --query 'services[0].{desired:desiredCount,running:runningCount}'
```

On the dashboard, "Targets up" and "Running tasks" show the count move.
The tasks-below-desired alarm compares desired with running, so a
scale-out does not trip it.

## What it costs

A scale-out is tasks, and tasks are the bill. The ceiling is the most an
environment spends on a service at once. The account's budget is the
catch-all under it: read its 80 percent notice when the flip has been on
for a while.

## When it fails

- **No scaling target after the flip.** The service's object carries
  `enabled = false`, or the apply did not run. Read the plan.
- **The count never rises.** The CPU stays under `target_cpu`: the load
  is elsewhere, often the database.
