# Becoming an operator

The operator plane reads every tenant, and writes them for a `write`
entry. Getting onto it takes four things, in order: an identity, a
grant, a second factor, and a token. A person does all four; an agent
does none of them, and works from the token the last step writes.

Set the environment first. Staging:

```
API=https://api.staging.tadas.fyi
ENV=staging
```

Production is `https://api.tadas.fyi` and `production`, and its grant
runs on `release` and waits for the deploy's reviewer.

## Sign in

Open the environment's app (`https://app.staging.tadas.fyi`) and sign in
through WorkOS with the email you will operate with. Nothing in the
deployment holds a credential for you, and a first sign-in is the
sign-up: it makes your identity and your personal org, with you as its
owner, a tenant account, which the grant turns into an operator.

## The grant

A person dispatches the workflow on the environment's branch. It runs
`tadas-api grant-operator` as a one-off task under the deploy role, and
the email is masked in the log.

```
gh workflow run grant-operator.yml --ref main -f environment=staging \
  -f email=<your email> -f permission=write        # or read
```

`read` is enough to investigate. `write` also changes a tenant's rows,
and the traffic generator's provisioner is the only identity that needs
it day to day. A person with `write` uses it for one named step, such
as sending a failed work item back (`tadas-ops work requeue`), which
mints a `write` token for that call alone.

## The steps in the terminal

These run in bash and zsh alike (`read -p` is bash only, so each prompt
is printed first). Everything happens in your own terminal: the sign-in
and the code never leave it.

1. **Enrol the second factor.** Until you do, the operator plane admits the enrolment and nothing else. There is no console screen yet, so enrol through the API, in your own terminal. A terminal signs in with the device sign-in: it prints a code and an address, you confirm the code in your browser, and it gets the sign-in.

   ```
   API=https://api.staging.tadas.fyi
   json() { python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('$1', ''))"; }

   sign_in() {  # prints a sign-in credential once you confirm the code
     d=$(curl -s -X POST "$API/v1/auth/device")
     printf 'open %s and confirm %s\n' "$(echo "$d" | json verification_uri_complete)" \
       "$(echo "$d" | json user_code)" >&2
     device=$(echo "$d" | json device_code)
     while :; do
       sleep 5
       t=$(curl -s "$API/v1/auth/device/token" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         -d "{\"device_code\":\"$device\"}" | json token)
       if [ -n "$t" ]; then echo "$t"; return; fi
     done
   }

   with_code() {  # $1 a sign-in credential, $2 a code: the sign-in that verified it
     curl -s "$API/v1/auth/second-factor" -H "Authorization: Bearer $1" \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"totp_code\":\"$2\"}" | json token
   }

   TOKEN=$(sign_in)
   curl -s -X POST "$API/v1/admin/me/totp" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
   ```

   The answer carries `otpauth_uri`, once. Add it to an authenticator app: most take the URI pasted, and any QR tool makes a code from it. Then confirm with the first code the app shows:

   ```
   printf 'code: '; read -r CODE
   curl -s -X POST "$API/v1/admin/me/totp/confirm" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"totp_code\":\"$CODE\"}"; echo
   ```

   It answers `identity_id` and `confirmed_at`. From now on the plane admits you only on a sign-in that verified a code.

2. **Check the fence**, once, while the shell still holds the sign-in (it lasts ten minutes):

   ```
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w 'no code: %{http_code}\n' "$API/v1/admin/orgs" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
   printf 'code: '; read -r CODE
   VERIFIED=$(with_code "$TOKEN" "$CODE")
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w 'with code: %{http_code}\n' "$API/v1/admin/orgs" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERIFIED"
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w 'signed out: %{http_code}\n' -X POST "$API/v1/auth/logout" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERIFIED"
   unset TOKEN VERIFIED CODE
   ```

   A sign-in without a code answers `401` on the plane. The code ends that sign-in and answers a new one, which answers `403 operator_token_required`: a sign-in with its code mints one token, the next step, and reads nothing itself. The last line signs it out, since it minted nothing. A tenant sign-in needs no code; the plane is what demands it.

3. **Write your token into the ops env file**, from the repository: `uv run tadas-ops token --env staging --identity operator`. It shows a code to confirm in your browser, asks for a code from your authenticator, writes `TADAS_OPERATOR_TOKEN` into `~/.config/tadas/ops/staging.env` (mode 600), and prints the token's id and nothing else of it. The mint ends the sign-in, so what is left is the token. A token lasts an hour; run it again when it runs out. Every ops skill works from that file, so no agent holds your sign-in or your code.

## When a token runs out

A token lasts an hour. Run step 3 again; it asks you to confirm a
sign-in and for a fresh code. Nothing else changes, and the skills pick
up the new value from the file.

## Ending a token before its hour

A token that leaked, or one you no longer need, ends now, one at a time:

```
uv run tadas-ops token --env staging --list          # your live tokens: id, permission, made, ends
uv run tadas-ops token --env staging --revoke <id>   # ends that one; its next request is 401
```

Both run under the file's own token, so if it has run out, write a
fresh one first (step 3). A token ends itself as well as the others:
revoke the id `token` printed, then write a fresh one. Without the
tool, the same two calls, and the sign-out, which ends the token it is
given:

```
curl -s "$API/v1/admin/me/tokens" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TADAS_OPERATOR_TOKEN"
curl -s -X DELETE "$API/v1/admin/me/tokens/<id>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TADAS_OPERATOR_TOKEN"
curl -s -X POST "$API/v1/auth/logout" -H "Authorization: Bearer <the token to end>"
```

You end your own tokens only, the ones the grant job minted for you
among them. Another operator's answer `404`: they end theirs, or the
grant job ends all of them (below). The provisioner's and the smoke
identity's tokens end by the sign-out above, or by the grant job.

## Deleting a team org

A `write` operator deletes a team org the way its owner does
([ADR 0042](../adr/0042-an-owner-deletes-a-team-org-closed-at-once-and-its-providers-by-the-queue.md)):

```
curl -s -X DELETE "$API/v1/admin/orgs/<org id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TADAS_OPERATOR_TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
```

The answer is the org, and nobody reaches it from then on: every
member, session, API key, and pending invitation in it is gone, and a
sign-in through its single sign-on finds nothing. Its `deleted_at` is
still `null`. The worker's `DELETE_ORG` item comes next. It deletes the
org's WorkOS organization, cancels its Stripe subscription and deletes
the customer, removes its Slack app, and then deletes the org, under
your identity. The org's rows stay for thirty days, then the sweep
purges them.

Until the item has run, the org is listed live and empty. Asking again
answers the same org and queues nothing more. A provider that is down
parks the item, and it goes on by itself once the provider answers. A
provider that refuses the call fails it for good: [the operate
runbook](operate.md#a-work-item-that-failed-for-good) says how to find
it and send it back once the cause is fixed.

A personal org is refused (`409 personal_org_fixed`). It goes only
with its person's account.

## Taking an operator off the plane

```
gh workflow run grant-operator.yml --ref main -f environment=staging \
  -f email=<email> -f permission=none -f disable=true
```

The entry is disabled, the identity keeps its tenant account, and every
operator token it holds and every sign-in with a code ends at once. A
grant made later revives none of them. That is also how a leaked token
of the provisioner or the smoke identity ends for good: disable the
identity, grant it again, and mint its token again with `mint_token`.
