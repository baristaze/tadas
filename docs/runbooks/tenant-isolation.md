# Tenant isolation: the cases, and the control that proves them

Tenancy is a data boundary and lives in storage. The predicate in the
query is the fence. `om/tests/unit/test_storage_exceptions.py` reads
signatures and says only that the tenant is offered to the query; a
method can take `org_id` and write a `WHERE` without it and pass there.
What says the query uses the tenant is the cross-tenant cases of the
contract suites: each presents another tenant's identifier and asserts
that nothing is found and nothing changes.

Each suite declares the methods it covers in a `CROSS_TENANT_CASES`
frozenset, and `test_every_tenant_method_is_named_in_a_cross_tenant_case`
holds those sets to the interfaces, so a storage method added with no
case fails the gate. That test reads names, not queries. A name listed
with no case behind it passes it. The control below is what keeps the
names honest.

## Running the control

A suite is worth what it catches, so the way to know is to break the
fence on purpose.

1. Pick one query. Take the tenant out of it: delete the `org_id`
   comparison from a `WHERE`, or swap a per-tenant helper for one that
   reads every row.
2. Run `make test-unit`. It must fail, and the failures must name the
   cross-tenant cases of the methods that query serves.
3. Put the predicate back and run `make test-unit` again. It must pass.

A predicate that goes missing with the suite still green is the finding
that matters. Write the case that catches it, confirm it fails, and add
it here.

Probe several queries, not one, and pick them to reach different
shapes: a helper the impls share, a method with a `WHERE` of its own,
a list, a page, the bulk write. The fast gate runs the memory impls,
so these are the queries a run here reaches. The Postgres queries carry
the same predicates in SQL and the same cases run over them under
`make test-integration`; a control against those runs on the compose
stack and is recorded here the same way.

## The last run: 2026-09-20, over the memory impls

Eight queries, one at a time, each against `make test-unit`. Every one
failed the suite.

| Query | What the suite reported |
|---|---|
| `MemoryStorageBase._get`, the shared single-row read | 13 failed, 904 passed |
| `MemoryStorageBase._rows`, the shared list | 42 failed, 875 passed |
| `MemoryStorageBase._put`, the shared write fence | 8 failed, 909 passed |
| `TasksStorageMemoryImpl._live`, the helper the two task lists share | 8 failed, 909 passed |
| `TasksStorageMemoryImpl.update_tasks`, the bulk write's own check | 1 failed, 916 passed |
| `TenancyStorageMemoryImpl.read_sessions`, a list with its own filter | 2 failed, 915 passed |
| `TenancyStorageMemoryImpl.read_api_keys`, a page with its own filter | 5 failed, 912 passed |
| `OutboxStorageMemoryImpl.mark_done`, a write with its own check | 1 failed, 916 passed |

The narrow probes name the case that catches them. The bulk write's
check is caught by
`test_a_bulk_update_refuses_a_row_of_another_tenant_and_lands_none`
alone; `mark_done` by `test_mark_done_is_per_tenant_and_idempotent`
alone; `read_sessions` by
`test_the_session_reads_and_writes_are_tenant_scoped` and the list's own
ordering case.

## The last run over Postgres: 2026-09-20

Two queries, one at a time, each against `make test-integration` on the
compose stack. Both failed the suite.

| Query | What the suite reported |
|-------|-------------------------|
| `TasksStoragePostgresImpl._live`, the helper the two task lists share | 5 failed, 116 passed, 1 skipped |
| `TenancyStoragePostgresImpl.read_sessions`, a list with its own `WHERE` | 1 failed, 120 passed, 1 skipped |

The same cases catch the same shapes over SQL as over the dicts. The
helper takes the two task lists, the cursor, the create, and the bulk
write down with it; the list with its own `WHERE` is caught by
`test_the_session_reads_and_writes_are_tenant_scoped` alone, which is
what a narrow probe should look like.

## The second fence, and the control that proves it is live

Since the row-level security adoption there are two fences. The
predicate in the query is the first and the only one the business layer
relies on; every policy in `om/migrations/sql/*/202609202000_row_level_security.up.sql`
is the second, and it catches the predicate that went missing. A control
against the second fence takes two runs, because a control that only
runs with the policy live proves nothing about the suite: run one says
the fence holds, run two says the suite would have seen the breach.

## The last run over Postgres with the policy live: 2026-09-20

One query, `TasksStoragePostgresImpl._live` in
`om/src/tadas/om/tasks/storage/impl/postgres.py`, the helper the two task
lists share and the query this runbook already names as the past hole.
The tenant comparison came out of it:

```python
def _live(org_id: UUID, status: TaskStatus) -> ColumnElement[bool]:
    return and_(Tasks.status == status.value, Tasks.deleted_at.is_(None))
```

Both runs are `uv run pytest -q -m integration --ignore=om/tests/integration/test_migrations.py`
on the compose stack. The migration round trip is left out on purpose:
it downgrades and upgrades every chain inside the run, which puts the
policy back under the second run's feet.

| Run | Policy on `core.tasks` | What the suite reported |
|-----|------------------------|-------------------------|
| One | live | `130 passed, 1022 deselected` |
| Two | `ALTER TABLE core.tasks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` | `6 failed, 124 passed, 1022 deselected` |

Run one is the second fence holding: every task query lost its tenant
and no case saw a row of another tenant, because the policy refused to
return one. Run two is the suite proving it can see a breach. It named:

```
om/tests/integration/test_row_level_security.py::test_every_table_holds_the_policy_its_scope_declares[tasks]
om/tests/integration/test_task_storage_postgres.py::TestTaskStoragePostgres::test_reads_are_tenant_scoped
om/tests/integration/test_task_storage_postgres.py::TestTaskStoragePostgres::test_the_done_list_is_tenant_scoped_on_its_own
om/tests/integration/test_task_storage_postgres.py::TestTaskStoragePostgres::test_a_cursor_of_another_tenant_pages_nothing
om/tests/integration/test_task_storage_postgres.py::TestTaskStoragePostgres::test_create_reports_another_tenants_id_and_lands_nothing
om/tests/integration/test_task_storage_postgres.py::TestTaskStoragePostgres::test_a_bulk_update_refuses_a_row_of_another_tenant_and_lands_none
```

Five are the cross-tenant cases the missing predicate reaches, the same
five the memory control finds. The sixth is the policy check itself,
which reads `pg_class` and says the table no longer holds what its scope
declares: the run disabled a fence and the suite said so, which is the
check doing its own job.

The predicate went back and the policy with it; `make test-integration`
is `137 passed, 1 skipped, 1022 deselected`.

Running it again: take one predicate out, run the suite with the policy
live and expect green, disable the policy on that table against the test
database and run again and expect red, then put both back. Read the
failures, not only the count: run two must name the cases of the methods
that query serves.

## The hole the control found

`read_done_tasks` carries a `WHERE` of its own, and the suite had a
cross-tenant case for the open list and none for the done list. The two
share the `_live` helper, so a change to the helper was caught and a
predicate dropped from the done list alone was not.

Taking the tenant out of `read_done_tasks` and nothing else, against the
suite as it stood:

```
903 passed, 109 deselected in 28.91s
```

Green. Every task any tenant has carried to done was readable by every
other tenant, through storage and through `GET /v1/tasks?status=done`,
and nothing said so.

The same breach against the suite as it stands now:

```
om/tests/unit/test_task_storage.py::TestTaskStorageMemory::test_a_cursor_of_another_tenant_pages_nothing
om/tests/unit/test_task_storage.py::TestTaskStorageMemory::test_the_done_list_is_tenant_scoped_on_its_own
services/api/tests/test_tenant_isolation_api.py::test_no_list_carries_another_tenants_rows
3 failed, 914 passed in 29.70s
```

Two things closed it. `test_the_done_list_is_tenant_scoped_on_its_own`
and `test_a_cursor_of_another_tenant_pages_nothing` in
`om/tests/contracts/task_storage.py` give the done list and its cursor
cases of their own. And `seed_tenant` in
`services/api/tests/test_tenant_isolation_api.py` now carries one task
to done in each tenant: the API sweep read the done half of the task
list all along, over two tenants that had nothing done, so it passed on
an empty page.

## What the impls disagree on

Nothing, on the cross-tenant paths. Both impls refuse the cross-tenant
call, change nothing, and tell the caller the same thing:

- `remove_member` under another tenant raises `NotFound` over both
  impls, the answer an id that never existed gets; the contract in
  `om/tests/contracts/tenancy_storage.py` asserts it.
- `append_event` naming an id another tenant holds is fenced before
  the sequence number is spent over memory, as Postgres rolls the
  number back with the insert it refused, so it never moves the naming
  tenant's cursor.
