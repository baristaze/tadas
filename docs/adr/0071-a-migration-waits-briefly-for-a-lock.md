# ADR 0071: A migration waits briefly for a lock

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-28)

## Context

The deploy migrates a live database. The migrate task runs inside the
apply, before the rollout, while the old tasks still serve. That is the
guideline's order (Migrating a Deployed Database), and expand and
contract keeps the old tasks correct over the new schema.

A migration's DDL takes a lock on its table. `DROP INDEX` and most
`ALTER TABLE` forms take `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`, and `CREATE INDEX` takes
`SHARE`. When a transaction of the serving tasks holds the table, the DDL
waits for it. While it waits, it holds its place in the table's lock
queue. Every read and write of the table that arrives after it queues
behind it, even one that does not conflict with the transaction that
holds the table. So one long transaction and one waiting migration stop
the whole table.

Measured on the local stack, with the API serving and a transaction that
read a table held open for 20 seconds: a migration step that drops an
index on that table, with no bound on its wait, waits 19.6 seconds and
then goes through. A request for the table sent while it waits queues
behind it and hits its own 10-second statement deadline: it answers 500
after 10.08 seconds.

The guideline holds the bound as a rule, STO-35 (Migrating a Deployed
Database): the migration's connection carries `lock_timeout` from
settings, a few seconds and under the serving statements' deadline, and
no statement deadline. A migration past it exits with a code that asks
for another run, and the deploy runs it again a bounded number of
times. The value of the bound, the exit code, and the number of runs
are the choices this decision makes.

## Decision

**Every statement of the migrate command waits for a lock 5 seconds at
most.** `TADAS_DATABASE_MIGRATION_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, a field of
`MigrationSettings`, is sent as `lock_timeout` in the startup packet of
the one connection the runner opens. So the bound holds for every
statement the runner sends: each migration of every role, `check`, and
`ensure-logins`, on the master's connection. A statement past it fails
with `55P03`, and the role's chain rolls back whole, as it does on any
failure.

**Five seconds is half the serving statements' deadline.** A request
that queues behind a waiting migration still has half of its 10 seconds
left when the migration gives up. A migration that needs a lock held
longer than that is behind a transaction that is too long for a live
table anyway.

**There is no statement deadline.** A backfill may run long, and a lock
it holds is one it was granted. The bound is on waiting, not on work.

**A run that gave up asks to be run again.** The command prints which
role gave up and exits 75, the temporary failure of sysexits. Nothing of
that role was applied. The roles before it are at their heads, so a
second run resumes where the first stopped. Every other failure exits 1.

**The pre-rollout task runs again on 75, three runs in all.**
`pre_rollout.sh` starts the same task again when the container exits 75.
The commands (`ensure-logins`, then `migrate --all`) are safe to repeat.
The next task's cold start, about a minute, is the wait between runs,
long enough for a serving transaction to end. A third 75 fails the apply
with the old tasks still serving, as any failed migration does, and the
next apply runs it again. The command itself never retries: a retry
inside it keeps the migrate task's connection and a place in the lock
queue through each wait, and hides the retries from the apply log.

**No migration builds an index `CONCURRENTLY`.** A role's chain runs in
one transaction, which refuses it, and it bounds nothing for `ALTER
TABLE` or `DROP INDEX`.

**One place opens a migration connection.** The Alembic environment
(`om/migrations/env.py`) refuses to run without the runner's connection,
as it refuses to run without a role, so no migration runs outside the
bound.

With the bound, the same run on the local stack, three times: the
migration step gives up after 5.4 seconds and exits 75, having applied
nothing. The request sent while it waits answers 200 in 4.94 to 4.97
seconds.

## Consequences

- A migration behind a long transaction costs the table 5 seconds of
  queueing at most, and the apply a minute or two of reruns.
- A migration that needs a lock held for longer than three runs allow
  fails the apply. The fix is to find the long transaction, not to raise
  the bound.
- `tadas-api migrate` and `python -m tadas.om.storage.migrate` exit 0, 1,
  or 75.
