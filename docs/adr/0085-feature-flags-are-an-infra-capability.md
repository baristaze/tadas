# ADR 0085: Feature flags are an infra capability, with the provider chosen at boot

**Status**: accepted (2026-10-08)

## Context

A release toggle turns unfinished work off in production, and a kill
switch turns a failing feature off without a deploy. Both decide at
runtime, per org and sometimes per person, whether a path runs. A
vendor's flag client called straight from a manager puts that vendor's
code at the heart of the system, where every other capability is an
interface with swappable impls.

What a tenant may do, or what a plan allows, is another thing: a
modelled entity with a manager and storage, never a flag.

## Decision

- **Flags are a capability like the cache and the secrets.**
  `FlagsInterface` is reached through `InfraInterface.get_flags()`, and a
  manager takes it in its constructor. One call,
  `evaluate(org_id, user_id=None)`, answers a `FlagSet`: every declared
  flag's value for that audience. A server check reads one value; a
  client's snapshot reads the flags marked for clients, through
  `GET /v1/flags`, with an `ETag` and `304`.
- **Flags are declared in code.** `Flag` is a `StrEnum`, and each flag
  has a default and a mark that says whether a client may read it. A
  flag the provider does not know, or a provider that fails, reads its
  default, and `evaluate` never raises.
- **One precedence in every impl.** A rule on the user wins over a rule
  on the org, that over the provider's default for the flag, and that
  over the code's. The user is the identity inside one org, one per
  membership: `TenantContext.user_id`.
- **The deployed impl evaluates in the process through OpenFeature.**
  The vendor's provider is chosen at boot from settings, inside
  `tadas.infra.flags`, and nothing else imports OpenFeature or a
  vendor's SDK. The targeting key is the org, so a percentage rollout
  is sticky per org; `org_id` and `user_id` are attributes, so a rule
  targets either. The scaffold names LaunchDarkly, whose Developer plan
  costs nothing, with its SDK key injected at start as the identity
  provider's key is.
- **The backend is a setting.** `TADAS_FLAGS_BACKEND` is `memory` (a
  rules file, local and tests only, refused in a deployed environment),
  `launchdarkly` (refused without its key, in every environment), or
  `none`, where every flag reads its default and the start line says
  so. A deployed environment starts on `none` and moves to
  `launchdarkly` once its key is in the secret store.
- **The flag provider is chosen apart from the identity provider.** No
  flag impl imports the identity integration or tenancy. The identity
  provider's own flag service is not an impl:
  - it targets its own organizations and users, so the impl would need
    tenancy's mapping from an org to its organization at the provider;
  - an org that signs in otherwise would have no flags;
  - it cannot target a person inside an org;
  - it costs a call per evaluation.
- **The first flag is `media-uploads`.** It defaults on, clients may
  read it, and `create_file` refuses a new upload with `feature_off`
  (403) where it is off for the caller's audience.

## Consequences

- A manager knows `FlagsInterface` alone, and arch-check's DEL-22
  decides an import of OpenFeature or a flag vendor's SDK anywhere else.
- Another vendor is another OpenFeature provider, chosen in
  `tadas.infra.flags`; no manager changes.
- An evaluation is in memory: the vendor's SDK streams its rules into
  the process, and a request pays no call. A process that cannot reach
  the vendor at boot waits at most `TADAS_FLAGS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, runs on
  the code's defaults, and says so.
- A client hides what a flag turns off, and the server refuses it
  whatever the client shows. The portal reads the snapshot once the
  exchange is done, again on focus and every five minutes, and drops it
  on a switch. No browser app depends on a flag vendor's SDK, and
  arch-check's DEL-52 decides it.
- In LaunchDarkly, a rule on `user_id` sits above a rule on `org_id`,
  since rules match in order, and an individual target on an org's key
  matches before both; the runbook says so.
