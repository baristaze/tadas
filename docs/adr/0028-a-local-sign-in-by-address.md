# ADR 0028: A local sign-in by address alone, refused in a deployed environment

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-26)

## Context

Sign-in is the identity provider's (ADR 0027): a person goes through a
hosted page in a browser and comes back with a code. Several callers
need a person without that round trip. `make seed` makes three people
the local stack is shown with; the demo recorders sign two of them in
and drive the portal and the command line; the traffic generator signs
in every person of a run; the unit, API, and integration tests sign in
hundreds of people. None of them has a browser, a mailbox, or a WorkOS
account, and CI has no WorkOS key.

The guideline refuses a local-only setting at boot (What a Process
Refuses): "Settings that are only safe locally are refused by the
process, not by a checklist."

## Decision

The API has one more sign-in door, the local sign-in: `POST
/v1/auth/dev-sign-in` with an email and an optional name answers what
every sign-in answers. The identity that holds the email is signed in,
or a new one is made with its personal org, as a first sign-in makes
one. The portal shows it at `/login/dev` when its runtime config says
so, which only the local build does; the command line has `tadas login
--dev-email`.

It is off unless `TADAS_DEV_SIGN_IN_ENABLED=true`. The API settings
refuse that value at boot unless `TADAS_ENVIRONMENT` is `local` or
`test`, naming the setting, so a staging or production process never
starts with it. Off, the route answers `404` exactly as a route that
does not exist does, before the body is read, and the manager refuses
it too, so a process built some other way cannot reach it either.

## Consequences

A developer's stack signs anyone in by typing an address. That is the
point, and it is safe only because nothing but a developer's machine
and CI can turn it on.

A traffic run against a deployed environment has no way to sign in its
people; it refuses to start there, and says why. A run on the local
stack or in CI is unchanged.

The name says what it is: `dev-sign-in` in the route, `dev_sign_in` in
the manager and the settings. A search for it finds every place it is
reachable.
