# ADR 0061: A push names the version its change wrote

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-28)

## Context

A frame and a replayed record carry the identity of a change (`seq`,
`kind`, `target_id`, the actor) and no field of the entity (Realtime at
the Edge). NET-30 lets one field through: the record's compare-and-set
`version`, which the write's outbox row carries and the relay copies
onto the event and the publish.

A client that follows the stream reads a record each time a push names
it, the tab that made the write included. That tab already holds the
record as the server wrote it, so its read brings back nothing new. The
actor cannot single it out: the same person's second tab has the same
actor, and that tab needs the read. The version can. Every write sets
it, the writer's tab holds it from the write's answer, and no other tab
holds it until it reads.

## Decision

**A record that carries a version names it in the outbox row of every
change.** The row's payload is `{"version": n}`
(`tadas.om.outbox.types.row.versioned_row`). The relay reads it into
`EntityChangedPayload.version`, and the frame's `EntityChangedView`
carries `version`. A row that names none leaves the field out of the
frame.

The orchestration record is the one record here that carries a version.
Its hint is a `versioned_row` on every write
(`om/src/tadas/om/orchestrations/steps.py`). A product's record with a
version does the same.

**A client that holds the record at that version need not read it.** A
push that names no version is read.

**A query a push keeps fresh is not read again on focus, or by the
clock, while the socket is open.** Its answer is as fresh as the last
push. In the portal its stale time is five minutes (`PUSHED_STALE_MS` in
`apps/portal/src/app/queryClient.ts`), a backstop, and the focus refetch
is off. A query no push names keeps ten seconds (`STALE_MS`) and the
focus refetch. When the socket is not open (connecting, degraded,
paused, closed), every query goes back to both at once.

## Consequences

The version is a counter, never a field's value. The stream already
tells every member that a record changed, when, and by whom, so the
count of changes is no new fact, and the payload holds nothing a
person's erasure has to find.

The event's payload is the row's, so the event keeps the version too.
The replay (`GET /v1/events`) does not serve the payload, so only the
socket's frame changes.

The frame's field is optional: a client that does not know it ignores it
and reads.
