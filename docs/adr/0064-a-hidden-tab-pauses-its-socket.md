# ADR 0064: A hidden tab pauses its socket

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-26).

## Context

An open socket has a cost on the server that does not depend on whether
anyone is looking. The credential recheck and the pings come to about
216 database round trips an hour, about 72 transactions
([ADR 0058](0058-a-socket-asks-again-and-its-pong-answers-from-the-bus.md)).
The socket also holds memory, a connection on an API task, and a
subscription on the bus.

The portal holds its socket for as long as the tab is open. A tab in the
background is still open, and a session lasts weeks. So most sockets
belong to tabs nobody is looking at.

A reconnect costs about 5 transactions: the ticket, its redemption, the
hello's head, and the replay from the cursor. An hour hidden costs about
72. Five minutes hidden costs about 6, so past five minutes a reconnect
is cheaper than the socket it replaces.

## Decision

**A tab hidden five minutes closes its socket, and the channel says
paused.** The wait is `HIDDEN_PAUSE_MS` in
`apps/portal/src/realtime/timeouts.ts`. A hide shorter than that calls
the wait off and never closes anything.

**A pause is not a failure.** No reconnect is scheduled, no failed cycle
is counted, the degraded polling stops if it ran, and no banner shows.
The degraded path of the guideline ("The channel degrades, it does not
disappear") is about a socket the client wants and cannot have. A
paused socket is one the client does not want yet.

**Any sign of the person's return resumes it.** The page turning
visible, a `pageshow` (a page restored from the back/forward cache
among them), a window `focus`, and `online`. Several at once make one
connect: only a paused channel connects. The resume is a first connect.
It asks for a fresh ticket, and the socket's open replays from the
cursor. A stream trimmed past the cursor is a resync, as on any
reconnect ([ADR 0040](0040-the-event-stream-has-a-floor.md)). An
`online` that finds the tab still hidden starts the five minutes over.

**While paused, no query counts as kept fresh by a push.** The query
cache keys that on the status `open`, and `paused` is not `open`. So
the focus that ends a pause also reads every stale query, and nothing
stays frozen if a resume were missed.

**A session that ended while paused signs out on return.** The ticket
request carries the session. The API answers it with 401, and the
transport client signs out, as it does for any request.

## Consequences

Measured in a local run: one tab of the portal before this change and
one after, on the same API, hidden ten minutes, with a task created at
minute seven. Visibility is set the way the portal reads it, since a
headless tab never really hides; the sockets and the API are real.

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Socket open while hidden | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Socket frames while hidden | 69 | 44, none after the pause |
| API requests while hidden | 1 (the read the push made) | 0 |
| API requests in the 30 s after the return | 0 | 4: the ticket, the replay, two task lists |
| The missed task shows after the return | at once | in 0.2 s |

The return costs one ticket and one socket, however many signals come
with it. A look away shorter than five minutes keeps its socket and
costs no reconnect. An hour hidden holds the socket for five minutes of
it, not sixty.

A paused tab learns of a change only when it returns. A reminder that
fell due meanwhile is announced then, from the replay, as after any
reconnect. A hidden tab shows no notice anyway.

`tadas listen` and the Python client are unchanged. A terminal has no
hidden state to pause on.
