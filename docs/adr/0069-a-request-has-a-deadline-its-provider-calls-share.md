# ADR 0069: A request has a deadline its provider calls share

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-26).

## Context

Every call to a provider carries a timeout, 10 seconds by default, and
each SDK keeps its own retries. So a provider that takes a call and never
answers holds it for the timeout on every attempt, plus the waits between
them:

| Provider | Attempts | A call gives up after, at most |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------|
| WorkOS | 4 | 50.5 seconds, and longer when a 429 or a 5xx asks for a longer wait: the SDK sleeps a `Retry-After` with no cap |
| Stripe | 3 | 31.5 seconds |
| Slack | 1 | 10 seconds (21.5 when the connection drops first) |
| AWS | 5 | 65 seconds |

A request that makes several calls waits for each in turn. A sign-in
through an org makes three WorkOS calls, an org's first invitation three,
a Slack uninstall two to Secrets Manager and one to Slack. Nothing bounded
the request as a whole.

Admission counts the requests in flight and bounds how many there are. It
does not bound how long one stays. Everything else that does is outside
the process, and shorter than those worst cases:

- the portal, the command line, and the Python client give up on a call
  at 30 seconds;
- a task that drains keeps a request 15 seconds of deregistration and 30
  of stop timeout, 45 in all;
- the load balancer and the CDN give up at 60 seconds.

Past any of these, nobody reads the answer, and the request still holds
its slot while its provider hangs. The guideline asks for this bound: the
gateway bounds a request with a deadline from settings (NET-26).

## Decision

**Admission gives a request its deadline.** When a request takes its
slot, `AdmissionMiddleware` stamps the instant its time runs out on the
scope: now plus `TADAS_REQUEST_DEADLINE_SECONDS`. The gateway mints the
request stage with it, and every stage refines that one, so `ctx.deadline`
is there wherever a request's work is. A socket and the three operational
routes get none. So does a worker's stage: an item is bounded by its lease.

**It is an instant, and it rides the context.** Calls made one after
another share what is left instead of each starting a budget of its own.
The guideline allows one context variable, the request id for the logs
(CTX-07), so the deadline is a field of `RequestContext`, and a manager
hands it to each call as an argument. A call that takes a deadline is
exactly a call a request can make: the identity provider's sign-ins,
invitations, and admin portal link; the processor's customer, checkout,
portal, and cancel; Slack's install exchange, uninstall, and revoke; and
AWS's queue send, secret reads and writes, and object put, get, and head.
A manager hands every such call its context's deadline, the worker's
calls through the same managers included, where it is none. A test scans
the managers and the API's services for a call without one.

**Each client keeps to it** (`tadas.infra.deadline.bounded`):

- A call that starts with no time left does not start.
- A call still waiting at the deadline is cut there: an attempt in
  flight, the wait between two attempts, or a wait the provider asked for.
- WorkOS goes further, because its SDK sleeps a `Retry-After` with no cap.
  Each attempt goes out with the smaller of the timeout and what is left.
  An answer whose `Retry-After` asks for longer than what is left ends the
  call at once instead of sleeping through the rest of the request. The
  SDK keeps its retries, its backoff, and its idempotency keys. A thin
  transport under the process's own HTTP client is what keeps to the
  deadline.
- Stripe, Slack, and AWS take their timeout per client, not per call, so
  the cut at the deadline is what bounds the attempt in flight.

**The refusal is the one a provider that does not answer already gets.**
WorkOS is `ProviderUnavailable`; Stripe and AWS are `BackendUnreachable`;
both are `503 unavailable`, which the portal and the command line already
read as "try again". A caller decides on a deadline the way it decides on
a timeout. A sign-in through an org that runs out of time while it reads
the org's invitations still signs the person in, and joins nothing, as
when WorkOS is down. Slack is `SlackFailed`, and the install's callback
sends the browser to the settings page with `slack=failed`, which asks the
person to add Tadas to Slack again. It does the same now when the org's
secrets did not take the token in time, where it used to answer an error
body to the browser.

**The default is 20 seconds.** A healthy provider answers in well under a
second, and the longest request, a sign-in through an org, makes three
calls. A hung one now costs a request 20 seconds at most. That sits under
the 30 seconds the clients wait, and leaves 10 for the refusal and the
database work around the calls. It sits under a draining task's 45 and the
load balancer's 60. It is one setting of the API, and the local default
serves every environment.

**The database keeps its own bound.** Every statement carries its 10
second deadline and every checkout its bound, from the pool's settings.
The outbox relay after the answer holds the slot too, and calls no
provider. The handler is not cancelled from outside: a cancel lands at any
`await`, between a provider's side effect and the row that records it,
and the deadline has nothing to wait for that those bounds do not already
hold.

## Worst case per route

Before, with every provider hanging, at the default timeouts:

| Route | Calls in turn | Before | After |
|-------|---------------|--------|-------|
| `POST /v1/auth/callback` | WorkOS exchange; through an org, the organization and the invitation lists | 50.5 s; 151.5 s and 50.5 per further page | 20 s |
| `POST /v1/auth/device`, `/device/token` | WorkOS start, or poll and the callback's org steps | 50.5 s; 151.5 s | 20 s |
| `POST /v1/invitations` | WorkOS organization, its creation, the send; on a conflict the pending list | 151.5 s; 202 s | 20 s |
| `POST /v1/invitations/{id}/resend`, `DELETE /v1/invitations/{id}` | WorkOS resend or revoke | 50.5 s | 20 s |
| `POST /v1/orgs/current/sso-link` | WorkOS organization (the first link), the portal link | 151.5 s | 20 s |
| `POST /v1/billing/checkout` | Stripe customer (the first), price, session | 94.5 s | 20 s |
| `POST /v1/billing/portal` | Stripe configurations (the first per process), session | 63 s | 20 s |
| `POST /v1/billing/cancel`, `/resume` | Stripe update | 31.5 s | 20 s |
| `GET /webhooks/slack/oauth` | Slack exchange, Secrets Manager create (and put when it exists) | 140 s; 280 s when it replaces a workspace | 20 s |
| `DELETE /v1/slack/installation` | Secrets Manager read, Slack uninstall, Secrets Manager delete | 140 s | 20 s |
| `POST /webhooks/stripe`, `/webhooks/slack/commands`, `/events` | SQS send (and the queue's address, the first per process) | 130 s | 20 s |
| `PUT` and `GET /v1/media/files/{id}/content`, `POST .../confirm` | S3 put, get, or head | 65 s | 20 s |

Every one was past the 30 seconds a client waits.

## Alternatives

- **A deadline per call instead of per request.** It bounds one call and
  not three in turn, which is the case the table shows.
- **A context variable read by the clients.** It keeps every signature as
  it was. The guideline allows one context variable, for the logs, and
  `arch-check` holds to it.
- **Cancel the handler at the deadline in the gateway.** It bounds the
  request without a word from the clients, and it lands at any `await`,
  a database statement or the step between a provider's side effect and
  its row among them. Each wait outside the process is already a call
  that can keep to the deadline itself.
- **Fewer retries on the request path.** It shortens a hung call and
  keeps a request unbounded when it makes several. A retry that fits in
  the deadline still helps.

## Consequences

- A provider that hangs costs a request 20 seconds, and the caller reads
  `503 unavailable`, where it read a 504 from the load balancer or its
  own timeout before.
- A method a request can call takes `deadline`, in each interface and
  each impl, the twins and the local stand-ins included, which have
  nothing to wait for.
- A worker's calls carry none. The worker still sleeps a WorkOS
  `Retry-After` with no cap while it renews its lease.
- The webhook routes take the request stage, so the OpenAPI document
  names their `x-app` and `x-app-version` headers, as the install's
  callback already did.
