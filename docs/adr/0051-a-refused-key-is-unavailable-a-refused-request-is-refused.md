# ADR 0051: A refused key is unavailable; a refused request is refused

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-26)

## Context

A provider refuses a call for one of two reasons. It refuses the
process's own credential: a key revoked, or a key without the
permission the call needs. Or it refuses the request itself: a code
that is spent, an invitation it will not send, a parameter it calls
invalid.

The first is not the call's fault: the same call goes through once a
person fixes the key, so work that made it must wait, not fail. The
second gets the same answer every time, and NET-33 retries only a
failure that can differ, so work that made it must fail at once.
A client that reads both as one refusal leaves work no way to tell
them apart: it either fails for good on a key a person could fix, or
retries a request that can never pass.

## Decision

**Every provider client tells the two apart on every call.** One
translation reads the SDK's error by whose problem it is. The identity
provider's client shows the shape:

| The provider answers | Raised | Status, code |
|----------------------|--------|--------------|
| `invalid_client` on any call, or `401` or `403` on a deletion (the key) | `ProviderUnavailable` | `503`, `unavailable` |
| `429`, or a `5xx`, after the SDK's own retries | `ProviderUnavailable` | `503`, `unavailable` |
| No answer, or the request's deadline passed | `ProviderUnavailable` | `503`, `unavailable` |
| `422` (something stands in the way) | `ProviderConflict` | `409`, `provider_conflict` |
| Any other `4xx` (the request) | `ProviderRefused` | `400`, `provider_refused` |

On a sign-in call, a `401` or a `403` is the person's: the provider
refuses the flow, as for an address it has not verified, so it stays a
refusal of the request. The refusal of the key names the setting
(`TADAS_WORKOS_API_KEY`), never its value, so the log says which key to
fix. A `404` on a deletion is not a refusal: the thing is gone already,
and a rerun is one deletion.

The Stripe client tells the two apart on every call:

| Stripe answers | Raised | Status, code |
|----------------|--------|--------------|
| `401`, `403` (the key) | `PaymentsKeyRefused`, a `ProviderUnavailable` | `503`, `payments_key_refused` |
| `429`, after the SDK's own retries | `ProviderUnavailable` | `503`, `unavailable` |
| No answer | `BackendUnreachable` | `503`, `unavailable` |
| `400`, `402`, `404`, an idempotency key reused (the request) | `PaymentsRefused` | `502`, `payments_refused` |
| `5xx`, anything else | `BackendFailed` | `500`, `backend_failed` |

A refused key is logged at error, naming the call, so the log says which
permission to add.

**Work reads the outcome by status.** The worker's `provider_calls`
reads every provider failure the same way. A `503` parks the item for a
minute, spending no attempt. A refusal of the request fails it for
good, with the refusal as its reason. Anything else is the queue's to
retry. `SYNC_SEATS`, `DELETE_ACCOUNT`, and `DELETE_ORG` share this one
reading.

## Consequences

A request under a refused key answers `503`, which a client reads as
"try again later", not as its own mistake.

A checkout, the portal, a cancel, or a resume under a refused key
answers `503` `payments_key_refused`, not `502` `payments_refused`. The
portal says billing is unavailable right now, with the request's
reference. A throttle answers `503` `unavailable`, not `500`
`backend_failed`. A refusal of the request answers `502`. The billing
read asks Stripe nothing. The webhook consumer leaves a delivery on the
queue for any failure.

An item under a refused key parks until a person fixes the key, and
then finishes. An item whose request the provider refused fails at
once, for an operator to read and requeue (`tadas-ops work requeue`).

A bootstrap command a person runs keeps its own translation: the person
reads the refusal, which names the missing permission.

A new provider client holds to the same split.
