# ADR 0039: Long-running work is a record; a guard parks it, a bound fails it

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-28)

## Context

Some work takes minutes, not a request. The guideline's "Long-Running
Orchestrations" makes it a durable record advanced by stateless
workers, claimed through a work item of its own, and rules that "a
guard parks, a bound fails". "Maintenance Without a Scheduler" has the
sweep open the next period of a record kept per period.

## Decision

**One mechanism, a namespace of its own.**
`om/src/tadas/om/orchestrations` holds the record, its storage in
Postgres and in memory under the tenant fence, and its manager:
`start`, `get`, `get_recent`, `resume`, `wake`, `fail`, and the purges.
The record (`Orchestration`) holds a kind, its input, a period, a
status, a cursor, a total, what the steps applied and skipped, the
first twenty skipped rows with a reason, a park reason, a fail reason,
and a version. The one kind is `noop`, the mechanism's own: it steps
through its input's count and changes nothing else. A product replaces
it with its kinds. Each declares an input shape in
`ORCHESTRATION_INPUTS` and a step in the namespace whose rows it
changes.

**A step is one commit.** A step's effect, the record's next cursor,
and the work row that asks for the next step land in one transaction.
The record rides it as a companion statement (`Step`), as an outbox row
rides a core write: the namespace's storage runs the record's
compare-and-set on its version in its own transaction, and rolls back
the effect with it when the record moved. So a worker that dies leaves
the record at its last committed step. A stale worker's step, one that
held an item past its lease, lands nothing. The applied count grows in
that commit by the rows the effect wrote.

**A step runs twice and does once.** What a step makes takes an id
derived from the record and the row (`base.derived_id`), so a second
run meets its rows already there.

**A guard parks, a bound fails.** A limit that can clear parks the
record at its cursor, in the step's own commit, and keeps what it made.
A park reason says what wakes it: `provider_unavailable`, a provider a
step calls did not answer or is marked out
([ADR 0088](0088-a-providers-outage-is-a-shared-signal.md)), and
`resource`, the record waits in line for a lease ([ADR
0086](0086-a-scarce-resource-is-leased-under-a-fencing-token.md)). The
work item `WAKE_PARKED` clears a reason: it resumes the org's records
parked for it, two seconds apart, or the one record it names, when the
reason was that record's alone. A park that knows when its reason may
clear lands the org's wake for then, one for every park that names the
same time. A person may resume a parked record too
(`resume`). A woken record is not trusted: its next step asks its guard
again. A bound of the input fails the record with its reason, which a
product adds beside `defect`. The park is the record's status, never a
deferred work item, so only the record says
why it waits.

**Everything else transient is the work queue's retry.** A database or
a store that does not answer makes the step raise, and the queue
retries the item with its growing delay, from the last committed
cursor. On the item's last attempt the handler fails the record as
`defect` instead of raising, so no record waits on work that will never
come. The storage layer's statement deadline bounds every batch.

**A record kept per period has a unique key.** The org, the kind, and
the period are unique (`uq_orchestrations_org_id_kind_period`): the
first start in a period opens its record, and every later start answers
it as stored. A sweep can open the period's record on every pass with
no scheduler, no leader, and no lock.

**Progress is pushed.** Every write of a record lands
`orchestrations.orchestration.<created|updated>`, with the record's id
and the version the write left
([ADR 0061](0061-a-push-names-the-version-it-wrote.md)). A client
follows a record on the realtime channel and reads it on each push it
does not already hold. Nothing polls.

## Consequences

The next long job is a kind, its input shape, a step in the namespace
that owns its rows, and, where it has a guard, a park reason and the
event that clears it.

One org's large job takes one step at a time, a work item each, so it
shares the worker's slots with every other org's work. When bulk work
starves its neighbours, the guideline's answer is a lane of its own for
the heavy kind.

Every transition counts under the subsystem `orchestrations`, labelled
by kind and outcome, and a `defect` is an `ERROR` line naming the
record and its org.

A settled record is purged thirty days later; a parked or running one
is kept. A record whose last attempt could not write its failure stays
running until its org is purged, and the work queue's dead letter
names it.
