# ADR 0037: A sign-in is exchanged once, and its retry signs in again

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-28)

## Context

A sign-in answers with a login credential (`lgn_`) and the person's
places. `POST /v1/auth/sessions` exchanges it for a session in one of
them. The login lives ten minutes (`TADAS_LOGIN_LIFETIME_SECONDS`). An
exchange that leaves the login standing makes another session on every
click of the org picker, and on every replayed request.

The guideline says the app "signs in once, picks a membership, and
exchanges it for one session", then "holds one session and drops the
sign-in credential" ("One Tenant at a Time"). "The Gateway" adds that a
creating `POST` accepts an `Idempotency-Key`, and a marker owns the
retry. The exchange leaves a session row behind, so the question is
what a retry after a lost answer gets.

## Decision

**The exchange ends the sign-in in the write that makes the session.**
`exchange_sign_in` is one named atomic write: the login row is locked,
refused when it is already ended, marked revoked, and the new session
is inserted, in one transaction. The login lives in the system scope,
so the write runs on the system login and sets the scope to the tenant
before the insert, as a switch does. Of two exchanges at once, one
lands. A second exchange answers `401` ("this sign-in was used already;
sign in again"). A refused exchange, for an org the person is not in,
ends nothing.

**The exchange takes no `Idempotency-Key`.** The sign-in is the key. It
is single-use, minted by the server, and ended in the same write as the
effect: the idempotent consumer's shape, "marker and effect are one
named atomic write". So no retry, replay, or second click can make a
second session.

A marker's other job is to replay the answer, and here it cannot. The
answer is the session token, and the idempotency records keep no
secret: a replay would hand back a session without its token. The one
way to hand back the same session is to keep its token in the clear,
and the tenancy namespace never keeps a credential it can be handed.

**A retry after a lost answer signs in again.** The session the lost
answer made reached nobody. Its token was never shown, so it can never
be presented, and it ends at its absolute lifetime like any other.

**The second factor and the operator's mint follow the same rule**
([ADR 0068](0068-an-operator-credential-ends-by-itself.md)).
`POST /v1/auth/second-factor` takes a sign-in and a TOTP code, answers
a new sign-in that records the code, and ends the one presented in the
same write. An operator's sign-in with its code is exchanged once, for
one operator token.

## Consequences

The portal's picker makes one exchange per choice, and the CLI's
`tadas login` one per sign-in. Neither sends a key. A pick that meets
the `401` says so, and the person signs in again.

A sign-in exchanged into a tenant is ended, so the operator plane
refuses it too. An operator who needs the plane and a tenant signs in
twice.

An ended sign-in is `revoked_at`, as an ended session is. The row keeps
its columns.
