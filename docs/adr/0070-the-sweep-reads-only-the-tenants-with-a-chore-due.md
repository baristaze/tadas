# ADR 0070: The sweep reads only the tenants with a chore due

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-26). Amends
[ADR 0045](0045-retention-purges-run-once-a-pass-across-tenants.md): the
standing chores no longer run in every tenant the ring takes. They run in
the tenants one read across tenants names.

## Context

After ADR 0045, a living tenant cost a pass its two chores and nothing
else. Each chore opened with a read of the tenant. The cleanup asked
whether the org had a done task past the archive age
(`read_archivable`), and the respace asked whether it had a long rank
(`read_long_place`). Almost every answer was no, and each cost a
transaction of three round trips. The system scope sat in the ring too,
and paid both reads for nothing.

Counted at the driver with the tools of the `audit-database-calls`
skill, on the audit seed (one heavy tenant, the rest personal orgs), a
pass cost:

| Tenants | Round trips | Transactions | Wall time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1,005, idle | 6,113 | 2,033 | 2.53 to 2.57 s |
| 5,005, idle | 30,173 | 10,053 | 15.4 to 16.5 s |
| 5,005, 1,000 of them with a chore due | 41,073 | 13,353 | 20.05 s, the budget, and the pass did not reach every tenant |

That is 65 + 6T + 3⌈T/200⌉ round trips over T tenants, the system
scope counted as one, every thirty seconds: about 200 a second at 1,000
tenants and 1,000 a second at 5,000, almost all of them answering
"nothing".

## Decision

**One read a pass, across tenants, names the tenants with a chore
due.** `TasksStorageInterface.read_tenants_with_chores(archivable_before,
after, limit)` is a named read in the system scope. Like the other
methods that take no tenant, it is listed with its reason. It is one
statement with two arms, each on a partial index that holds only the
rows it may find:

- the done tasks not archived, on the new
  `ix_tasks_updated_at_org_id_done_unarchived (updated_at, org_id)
  WHERE status = 'done' AND archived_at IS NULL AND deleted_at IS
  NULL`. The day's cut is a range of it, so only the archivable tasks
  are read. The read names the status as the same literal, so the
  predicate is proven by any plan, as the files purge does
  ([ADR 0056](0056-purges-across-tenants-plan-with-their-values.md));
- the open tasks whose rank grew long, on `ix_tasks_org_id_rank_long`,
  the index the respace already reads.

It returns each tenant once, in id order, at most `limit`, after
`after`. It is planned with its values, as the purges across tenants
are (ADR 0056). A generic plan knows neither the cut nor the tenant a
page starts after, and on the integration suite's data it walked the
tenant-led index of every unarchived task instead. The `SET LOCAL`
costs one round trip a pass.

**The day's cut holds all day.** The cleanup took the done tasks
unchanged for 90 days as of the moment it opened. A task that crossed
the line later in the day was archivable again, and the day's record,
opened already, could not take it. Its org would have been named on
every pass for the rest of the day, for a read of its record and
nothing else. So the day's cleanup takes the done tasks that were past
the archive age when the UTC day began (`tasks.rules.archive_cutoff`),
and the read uses the same cut. Once the day's record has run, the org
has nothing archivable until the next day begins. A task that turns 90
during a day is archived the next day: still once a day, at most a day
later than before.

**The chores are a phase of the pass, before the ring.** The loop reads
a page of the tenants with a chore due (`LoopOptions.chore_batch`,
1,000), and runs each tenant's chores once, under the service context
the pass listed for it. Past the budget it takes no new tenant, but
always one. The next pass reads on from the last tenant this one ran,
and a page that came back short and ran whole sends the next pass back
to the first. So more than a page of tenants with a chore due is a page
a pass, and each is reached within ⌈D/1,000⌉ + 1 passes. A tenant the
read names that has no context in the pass, purged or made since the
list was read, waits for the next pass.

The ring keeps the purge of a tenant past its retention and the mark of
a tenant purged. A chore that fails no longer holds a tenant's mark
back: a tenant with no task left is named by no read.

**The index earns its writes.** It takes an entry only from a write
that leaves a task done, not archived, and not deleted: a completion, an
edit of a done task, a restore, and one per task of a bulk completion.
A write that leaves a task open, archived, or deleted writes it none, so
a create, a move, a respace, a reopen, and the cleanup's archive cost it
nothing. Every write to a task changes `updated_at`, which two indexes
already hold, so none of those writes was a HOT update before this one.
The index adds one B-tree insert of a timestamp and a uuid to a write
that already updates several. It holds each tenant's Done shelf, which
the cleanup keeps to 90 days: 1.5 MB for the 25,000 such tasks of the
5,000-tenant seed, beside a table of 67 MB.

## Alternatives

- **A skip scan of the tenant-led done-shelf index**
  (`ix_tasks_org_id_status_updated_at_id_unarchived`) needs no new
  index. It descends once per tenant, a cost that grows with every org
  made, which is what this change removes.
- **A read per chore** would run each chore only where it is due, for
  four more round trips a pass. The one read runs both chores in each
  tenant it names, so a tenant due for one pays the other's probe,
  three round trips, and only in a tenant with work to do.
- **Visiting only the named tenants and the expired ones**, instead of
  listing every org, needs the tenancy manager to name the expired
  ones. The list is three round trips per 200 tenants, the one term of
  an idle pass that still grows with tenants.

## Consequences

The same flows, over the same seeds, at `main` and on this change:

| Pass | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| 1,005 tenants, idle | 6,113 round trips, 2,033 transactions, 2.53 s | 87 round trips, 24 transactions, 0.06 s |
| 1,005 tenants, 100 with a chore due | 8,013, 2,633, 3.39 s | 2,587, 824, 1.05 s |
| 5,005 tenants, idle | 30,173, 10,053, 15.4 to 16.5 s | 147, 44, 0.16 to 0.22 s |
| 5,005 tenants, 100 with a chore due | 32,073, 10,653, 18.2 s | 2,647, 844, 1.24 s |
| 5,005 tenants, 1,000 with a chore due | 41,073, 13,353, 20.05 s, unfinished | 23,867, 7,644, 10.98 s |

An idle pass is 69 + 3⌈T/200⌉ round trips in 18 + ⌈T/200⌉
transactions: the steps across tenants, and the org list the ring
needs. A tenant with a chore due costs 23 to 25 round trips and about
10.7 ms. The read takes 0.13 ms when nothing is due and 1.2 ms naming
880 tenants (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the 5,000-tenant seed).

**Running the chores in parallel stays deferred**
([TAZ-124](https://linear.app/taze/issue/TAZ-124)). Its trigger was the
pass nearing its budget, then about 6,000 orgs. Measured after this
change:

- An idle pass grows by about 25 µs a tenant, for the org list and the
  ring in memory: 0.06 s at 1,000 tenants and 0.2 s at 5,000. It nears
  16 s, four fifths of the budget, around 600,000 tenants.
- A pass takes at most a page of tenants with a chore due, about 11 s
  for a full page. A full page happens at the start of a UTC day, when
  each org with a done task that turned 90 the day before is due. It
  drains at a page a pass, a pass every 41 s or so (the pass, then the
  30 s interval): about 90,000 orgs an hour. A pass with a full
  page nears 16 s around 200,000 tenants, or once a tenant's chores
  cost over 15 ms.

So the trigger is now: the pass duration's p95 over a day reaches 16 s
outside the first hour of the UTC day, or the day's first burst of
tenants with a chore due takes more than an hour to drain, about
90,000 due orgs. When it fires, the calls come down before any chore
runs in parallel. The read can say which chore is due in each tenant,
so a due tenant skips the probe of the chore not due in it and the
cleanup's own probe: up to 6 of its 23 round trips. The cleanup's read of the
day's record can fold into its insert: 3 more.
