# ADR 0063: Sessions last weeks

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-26)

## Context

A session ends at whichever comes first: its absolute lifetime, counted
from its exchange, or its idle lifetime, counted from its last use. Both
are settings (CTX-36), and the guideline names no value for either.

A task list holds a team's work, not its money or its secrets. A
person who meets a sign-in every Monday morning, or after every
lunch, pays for a bound that protects little. So does `tadas` in a
terminal: the CLI keeps one session in a file, and it lapses with it.

NIST SP 800-63B puts a sign-in with one factor at the lowest assurance
level, AAL1. At that level it asks for re-authentication about once
every 30 days of an extended session, and it sets no idle timeout. A
tenant session here rests on one factor: an email code or link, Google,
GitHub, or the team's own single sign-on.

## Decision

**A session lasts 30 days, and 14 days idle.**
`TADAS_SESSION_LIFETIME_SECONDS` defaults to 2592000 and
`TADAS_SESSION_IDLE_LIFETIME_SECONDS` to 1209600, in the settings, in
`.env.example`, and in the tenancy manager's own options. A person who
uses Tadas signs in once a month. One who stays away for two weeks signs
in when they come back. The bounds are weeks, never hours or days: with
a day idle and a week in all, a person who takes a weekend off signs in
on Monday, for no assurance AAL1 asks for. The idle lifetime stays,
though AAL1 asks for none: a session nobody used for two weeks is more
likely a forgotten laptop than a person, and the idle clock costs one
write a minute at most.

**Only a person's requests move the idle clock.** `authenticate` and
`authenticate_login` record a use, at most once a minute. The socket's
recheck calls `resume` with `record_use=False`
([ADR 0058](0058-a-socket-asks-again-and-its-pong-answers-from-the-bus.md)),
so an open tab never keeps a session alive by itself. A tab left open
for 14 days with no request is signed out at its next recheck.

**Nothing moves the deadline.** Only the exchange of a sign-in starts
the 30 days. A session presented to the exchange is a switch: it ends,
and the new session keeps its deadline, in another org or in the same
one. The session an owner lands on after deleting a team org keeps it
too. So a session never renews itself, and no chain of switches
outlives its sign-in. When the setting gives less than the deadline
leaves, the new session takes the shorter of the two.

**WorkOS's session mirrors ours.** A sign-in through AuthKit leaves an
AuthKit session in the browser, and while it lives, the next sign-in
there has no prompt. The portal keeps its session in the tab, so a new
tab signs in again, and the AuthKit session decides whether the person
sees a prompt. The Tadas App's Sessions tab sets it to the same two
bounds: 30 days maximum, 14 days of inactivity. That tab has no API, so
`tadas-ops workos-bootstrap` prints both as checks, and the WorkOS
runbook says where they are. WorkOS's settings never end Tadas's
session early or keep it alive: Tadas reads the access token once, for
its session id, and never refreshes it.

**Nothing else moves.**

- A revoked session is refused at its next request, since every request
  reads it. An open socket closes at once when the bus carries the
  revocation, and within one recheck, five minutes, when it does not.
- An operator token lives an hour at most. The operator plane needs a
  second factor and keeps its own bound.
- An API key keeps its own expiry and its cap of 90 days.
- A sign-in is exchanged within ten minutes
  (`TADAS_LOGIN_LIFETIME_SECONDS`).
- The token stays in the tab's session storage, so a closed tab forgets
  it whatever its lifetime.

## Consequences

- A person signs in about once a month, and after two weeks away.
- A stolen session token works for longer: up to 30 days from its
  sign-in, or until the person signs out, a member is removed, or the
  session is revoked. A switch made with it buys no time. A revocation
  takes effect at the next request.
- A session row goes once its expiry is past the retention, thirty days.
  A revoked session waits for its expiry, and so does one that ended
  idle, so a dead session stays up to 60 days. It is refused at every
  read meanwhile, and it holds only a digest. A purge by idle time would
  need an index on `last_seen_at`, and nothing measured asks for one.
- The Tadas App's Sessions tab holds 30 days and 14 days in each WorkOS
  environment. A person sets them; no API writes them.
