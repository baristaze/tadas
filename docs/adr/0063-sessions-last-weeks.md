# ADR 0063: Sessions last weeks

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-26). Amends
[ADR 0026](0026-what-0-31-0-leaves-as-a-choice.md): its bullet on the
session lifetimes. The lifetimes are longer than the guideline's
defaults now, not shorter.

## Context

A session ends at whichever comes first: its absolute lifetime, counted
from its exchange, or its idle lifetime, counted from its last use. Both
are settings (CTX-36). The guideline's scaffold defaults them to 24
hours idle and 7 days absolute. Tadas set 4 hours idle and 12 hours
absolute, so a person signed in about once a working day.

That is strict for what Tadas is. A task list holds a team's work, not
its money or its secrets. A person who opens it after lunch, or on
Monday morning, meets a sign-in. So does `tadas` in a terminal: the CLI
keeps one session in a file, and it lapses overnight.

NIST SP 800-63B puts a sign-in with one factor at the lowest assurance
level, AAL1. At that level it asks for re-authentication about once
every 30 days of an extended session, and it sets no idle timeout.
Tadas asks one factor for a tenant session: an email code or link,
Google, GitHub, or the team's own single sign-on.

## Decision

**A session lasts 30 days, and 14 days idle.**
`TADAS_SESSION_LIFETIME_SECONDS` defaults to 2592000 and
`TADAS_SESSION_IDLE_LIFETIME_SECONDS` to 1209600, in the settings, in
`.env.example`, and in the tenancy manager's own options. No deployed
environment sets either, so each takes the default. A person who uses
Tadas signs in once a month. One who stays away for two weeks signs in
when they come back.

**Only a person's requests move the idle clock.** `authenticate` and
`authenticate_login` record a use, at most once a minute. The socket's
recheck calls `resume` with `record_use=False`
([ADR 0058](0058-a-socket-asks-again-and-its-pong-answers-from-the-bus.md)),
so an open tab never keeps a session alive by itself. A tab left open
for 14 days with no request is signed out at its next recheck.

**WorkOS's session mirrors ours.** A sign-in through AuthKit leaves an
AuthKit session in the browser, and while it lives, the next sign-in
there has no prompt. The portal keeps its session in the tab, so a new
tab signs in again, and the AuthKit session decides whether the person
sees a prompt. The Tadas App's Sessions tab sets it to the same two
bounds: 30 days maximum, 14 days of inactivity. `tadas-ops
workos-bootstrap` prints both as checks, and the WorkOS runbook says
where they are. WorkOS's settings never end a Tadas session early or
keep it alive: Tadas reads the access token once, for its session id,
and never refreshes it.

**Nothing else moves.**

- A revoked session is refused at its next request, since every request
  reads it. An open socket closes at once when the bus carries the
  revocation, and within one recheck, five minutes, when it does not.
- An operator token lives an hour at most. The operator plane needs a
  second factor and keeps its own bound.
- An API key keeps its own expiry and its cap.
- A sign-in is exchanged within ten minutes
  (`TADAS_LOGIN_LIFETIME_SECONDS`).

## What leaned on 12 hours, checked again at 30 days

- **The event stream's rollout** ([ADR 0040](0040-the-event-stream-has-a-floor.md)).
  A tab older than the trim's release meets the trim only if it lives
  through two deploys with its cursor 90 days behind. It argued that a
  12-hour session rules this out. A 30-day session rules it out too,
  since 30 is less than 90. The argument holds, and both steps of that
  rollout are done anyway.
- **The socket's bound on a lost revocation** (ADR 0058). A socket
  closes at its credential's expiry, which is now up to 30 days away,
  as a key's already was up to 90. The expiry was never the bound that
  mattered: the recheck is, and it runs every five minutes whatever the
  lifetime.
- **The sweep's purge of sessions.** A session row goes once its expiry
  is past the retention, thirty days. A revoked session waits for its
  expiry, and one that ended idle does too. So a dead session stays up
  to 60 days, where it stayed up to 30 and a half. It is refused at
  every read in the meantime, and it holds only a digest. The sessions
  table grows with it, at most about twice. A purge by idle time would
  need an index on `last_seen_at`, and nothing measured asks for one.
- **The portal's storage.** The token stays in the tab's session
  storage, so a closed tab forgets it whatever its lifetime. Nothing in
  the portal or the Python client counted on a daily sign-in: neither
  keeps a timer, a cookie, or a refresh.

## Alternatives

- **The guideline's defaults, 24 hours idle and 7 days absolute.** A
  person who takes a weekend off signs in on Monday. That is the
  friction this change removes.
- **No idle lifetime.** AAL1 asks for none. But a session nobody used
  for two weeks is more likely a forgotten laptop than a person, and the
  idle clock costs one write a minute at most.
- **Keep the token across tabs, in local storage.** Then a new tab
  would need no sign-in at all. But every tab and every later visit
  would read it, and a shared computer would keep it after the tab
  closed. The tab's own storage stays; AuthKit's session covers the new
  tab.

## Consequences

- A person signs in about once a month, and after two weeks away.
- A stolen session token works for longer: up to 30 days, or until the
  person signs out, a member is removed, or the session is revoked. A
  revocation still takes effect at the next request.
- The Tadas App's Sessions tab holds 30 days and 14 days in each WorkOS
  environment. A person sets them; no API writes them.
