# ADR 0018: The operator allowlist carries a role, and an operator signs in as a person

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-20), amended (2026-09-22): only the
grant job writes the allowlist, and an agent holds an operator token,
not a password.

## Context

"The Operator Context" admits an identity to the operator plane when
it is on the operator allowlist, and "Operator Roles" says the
supporter reads a named tenant's rows through that plane with an
allowlist entry that says read. Until now the allowlist was one
boolean on the identity, `is_operator`, so every operator could delete
an org, and an agent holding a support credential held that too.

The operator plane also had no way in for an agent but a person's own
sign-in: there is no operator API key, and a tenant API key produces a
tenant context, which the plane refuses by type.

## Decision

The boolean becomes `Identity.operator_role: OperatorRole | None`,
`read` or `write`, and write includes read. `admit_operator` fills
`OperatorContext.permissions` from it, and every operator operation
requires one: the reads (`get_orgs`, `get_org`, `get_members`,
`get_tasks`, `get_events`, `size`) require read, the writes
(`create_org`, `add_member`, `delete_org`) require write. `bootstrap
--operator` grants write, and `--operator-role read` grants read.

An operator signs in as the person they are, through
`POST /v1/auth/login`, and presents the identity token; no tenant
session is exchanged, because the plane admits the identity stage. The
supporter's credential in `~/.config/tadas/ops/<env>.env` is therefore
an operator identity's email and password whose entry is read, and the
skill reads `GET /v1/me/identity` to check the entry before it reads a
tenant. The traffic generator, which creates tenants of its own, holds
a second identity in the same file, the provisioner, whose entry is
write; nothing else reads it. Every operator read of a tenant's rows
logs one line with the org id and the operator's identity id, and no
tenant data.

The two operator creates carry an `Idempotency-Key` like every
creating route. Their markers have no tenant, so they are recorded
under the system scope (`EMPTY_UUID`) keyed by the operator's identity
id, through `begin_for_operator`, `finish_for_operator`, and
`release_for_operator` on the idempotency manager, and the system-scope
sweep that purges the platform's own markers purges them too. The CLI's
`bootstrap` and `add-member` and the operator's `create_org` and
`add_member` share one private path, `tenancy/impl/creates.py`, so the
seed and the API create the same rows.

## Consequences

- A support agent cannot delete an org, create one, or add a member,
  whatever it is told, because its entry does not carry write.
- An operator API key is a later step. It needs a credential kind that
  produces an identity stage and not a tenant one, and a place to
  store it that is not a tenant's `api_keys`. Until then the operator's
  sign-in is a password in an owner-only file, which is the same
  posture as the cloud profiles beside it.
- The migration renames a column in one step, which
  [ADR 0006](0006-pre-release-compatibility.md) allows before the
  first deployment. It is the last such rename: the environments are
  about to exist, and from the first deploy a rename is two releases.
- Operator markers live under the system scope by design; a later
  operator namespace of its own would move them, and nothing else.

## Amended: the grant job and operator tokens

- **Only the grant job writes the allowlist.** In a deployed
  environment `tadas-api grant-operator --email <e> --permission
  read|write`, or `--disable`, is the one writer of `operator_role`. It
  runs as a one-off task from `grant-operator.yml` (ADR 0022), audited
  under the system scope. `bootstrap --operator` and `--operator-role`
  are local only.
- **A person signs in with a second factor.** An operator enrols a
  TOTP secret with `POST /v1/admin/me/totp` and `/confirm`. Until it is
  confirmed, the plane admits the enrolment and nothing else; after,
  it admits a sign-in only when that sign-in verified a code, and a
  code is accepted once.
- **An agent holds an operator token.** A token is a `sessions` row of
  kind `operator_token` under the system scope: one permission, an hour
  at most, stored as its digest, capped by the entry on every request.
  A person mints one with `POST /v1/admin/me/tokens` from a sign-in
  with a code, and the grant job mints the provisioner's and the smoke
  identity's into the secret store. So the env file under
  `~/.config/tadas/ops/` holds `TADAS_OPERATOR_TOKEN` (read) and
  `TADAS_PROVISIONER_TOKEN` (write), never an email and password.

This is the operator credential the Consequences above call a later
step. It produces an identity stage, not a tenant one, and it lives in
`sessions`, not in a tenant's `api_keys`.
