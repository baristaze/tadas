# ADR 0014: Tenancy's re-mint reads the idempotency marker in its own statement

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-20)

## Context

Shape of an Operation makes the re-mint of a secret on a rerun the one
rerun write that changes what is stored, so "the statement writes the
digest only while the marker still holds the attempt making the write".
The Gateway makes `finish`, the release, and the re-mint conditional on
the attempt token, and NET-24 and NET-25 rate a re-mint with no such
guard `high`.

That one statement sees two namespaces' rows: tenancy owns the API key,
and idempotency owns the marker. A fence on anything weaker, such as
the row's birth time, admits an attempt that lost its marker: it
re-mints, hands out a second secret, and silently invalidates the one
the retry already returned.

## Decision

The re-mint reads the marker in its own `WHERE`. In Postgres,
`issue_api_key` carries an `EXISTS` over `idempotency_records` on
`(org_id, target_id, attempt_id, status IS NULL)`. The memory impl asks
an `AttemptFenceInterface` the storage root injects, the twin of the
`OutboxLandingInterface` it injects to land outbox rows. An attempt with
no marker (a request with no `Idempotency-Key`) does not re-mint at
all.

The fence is keyed on the API key's own id, never on the caller's
`Idempotency-Key` string: the marker must be the one for this id, and
no HTTP header value enters the tenancy namespace.

This is the second sanctioned crossing of a swimlane. It rests on the
sentence that licenses the first: "Two system rows are touched by every
namespace: the outbox row, which announces a write, and the idempotency
marker, which owns a retry." Tenancy lands the outbox row inside its own
statement, and reads the marker in the same one.

## Consequences

The fence depends on "no cross-role statements": `api_keys` and
`idempotency_records` are both in the `core` role, and
`test_the_re_mint_reads_the_marker_inside_one_role` pins it. Moving
either table to another role breaks the fence, and the test says so
before a deployment does.

The fence finds its marker through `ix_idempotency_records_attempt_id`,
the partial index on the pending markers by attempt, which the purge
reads too.

The attempt travels from the gateway to storage as an `Attempt` value
object, never as two bare ids of the same type, so a caller cannot swap
them.
