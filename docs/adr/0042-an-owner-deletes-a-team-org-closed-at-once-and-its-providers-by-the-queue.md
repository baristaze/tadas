# ADR 0042: An owner deletes a team org, closed at once, and its providers by the queue

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-26)

## Context

A person deletes their account only once they are not the last owner
of a team org
([ADR 0041](0041-an-account-is-deleted-at-once-and-its-providers-by-the-queue.md)).
So an owner needs two ways out: make someone else an owner, or delete
the org.

An owner who deletes their org means all of it: its people lose it
now, the plan stops billing, the Slack app leaves, and its organization
at the identity provider goes too, with its connections and pending
invitations.

## Decision

**An owner deletes their team org, from a session.** `POST
/v1/orgs/current/deletion` carries the org's name as the owner typed
it, forgiving surrounding space and nothing else. Only an owner's
session is heard: an admin, a member, and an API key are refused (`403
not_authorized`). A personal org is refused (`409 personal_org_fixed`):
it goes only with its person's account.

**The org closes in one commit.** One named atomic write,
`TenancyStorageInterface.write_closed_org`, lands the org row with its
provider organization cleared, soft-deletes every live user of the
tenant with their membership, revokes every live session and API key,
and revokes every pending invitation. Each ended user lands
`tenancy.user.deleted`, and each credential its revocation row, so
every socket closes. From the answer on, nobody reaches the org: no
credential works, no org picker offers it, and no sign-in through the
provider finds it.

**The providers go through the queue, after the close.** The same
commit asks for `DELETE_ORG` in the org, with the provider
organization's id in its payload. The worker deletes that organization,
cancels the subscription and deletes the customer at Stripe, removes
the Slack app, and deletes the org, in that order, and each step finds
its own work done on a rerun. A provider out of reach, or one that
refuses the process's own key, parks the item without spending an
attempt. A provider that refuses the call fails it at once, for an
operator to requeue
([ADR 0051](0051-a-refused-key-is-unavailable-a-refused-request-is-refused.md)).
Slack's side stays best effort. The org waits, live and empty, because
a claim refuses an item of a deleted org.

**The org's data goes the retention's way.** The worker's last step
writes `deleted_at`, keeps the org row as the record, and announces
`tenancy.org.deleted`. The sweep purges the tenant after the thirty-day
retention. A team org is not a person, so it keeps the retention that
guards against a mistake.

**An operator's deletion takes the same path.** `DELETE
/v1/admin/orgs/{org_id}` writes the same close and asks for the same
`DELETE_ORG`, with the operator's identity as the actor of every row.
So an org deleted on the operator plane stops billing, leaves its Slack
workspace, and lets go of its WorkOS organization. It answers the
closed org, whose `deleted_at` stays unset until the worker has deleted
it. A repeat before then answers the org as it stands and asks for
nothing more. A personal org is refused.

**The owner lands in their personal org.** The same request makes a
session in the owner's personal org, as a switch does, carrying the
provider session the asking one came from, and the portal takes it up
and opens the task list there. When that session cannot be made, the
answer carries none and the owner signs in again: the org is deleted
either way.

**Settings changes a member's role.** A member who manages members gets
a role control on each other member (`RoleControl`), holding the roles
the server's rules let them give: never their own role, never a member
above their own role, never a role above it. So an owner can make
someone else an owner, and an admin cannot. The route is `PATCH
/v1/memberships/{user_id}`.

## Consequences

An owner can leave without an operator: hand the org on, or delete it,
then delete the account.

The org's rows stay for thirty days after the worker deletes it. An
operator can read them in that time; nobody can restore them.

While a provider is down, or refuses the key, the org waits, empty, and
its subscription keeps billing until the provider answers.
Until the worker has run, the operator plane lists the org live and
empty and counts it among the tenants. Nobody joins it meanwhile: an
operator's add of a member to it is refused as not found.

The worker deletes the provider organization with the Tadas App's own
key, the one that makes the API's organization calls. Stripe's runtime
key already has Customers and Subscriptions at Write. No key gains a
permission.
