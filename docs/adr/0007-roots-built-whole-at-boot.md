# ADR 0007: Roots are built whole at boot, once per process

**Status**: accepted (2026-09-18)

## Context

`build_managers` constructs every manager at boot. The storage and
infra roots construct every namespace impl and every capability impl
the same way, whether or not the process ever calls them. The question
is whether a lazy root, a manager built on first use, would make a
process that serves a narrow flow cheaper.

Measured with `make benchmark-boot` (warm, Apple silicon):

| Step | Cost |
|------|------|
| import `tadas.om.root` (every manager and storage module) | ~160 ms |
| import `tadas.infra.impl.configured` | ~125 ms |
| import `tadas.services.api.app` (FastAPI, routers) | ~165 ms |
| `StorageMemoryImpl()`, `InfraLocalImpl()` | ~0.01 ms |
| `build_managers()` over either storage root | ~0.03 ms |
| `StoragePostgresImpl()` (engines built, nothing connects) | ~9 ms |

A root costs its imports, and a process pays them once, at module load,
before any constructor runs. Construction takes microseconds: an impl
holds references and opens nothing. Connections open at `start()` or on
first use of the engine pool, never in a constructor. Nothing is built
per request: routers resolve the one `Managers` object the container
holds, and `services/api/tests/test_container.py` asserts that
`build_managers` runs once for any number of requests.

## Decision

Roots are whole and built up front. `build_managers`, both storage
roots, the configured infra root, and the services root construct every
member at boot, once per process, in dependency order.

A lazy root is refused. It saves nothing measurable, and it moves a
wiring error from boot, where the process exits and the readiness probe
stays red, to the first request that needs the missing piece, after the
probe already reports ready. Lazy imports are refused for the same
reason: they move the same ~450 ms from boot to a request's tail
latency.

A short-lived process (`tadas-api migrate`, `tadas` in command mode) pays
the imports of the packages it names once per invocation, about 100 ms
for the CLI. That is the floor a Python process has.

## Consequences

A new manager is one line in `Managers` and one call in
`build_managers`, never a getter that builds on demand. The per-scope
caches in the infra roots follow the same rule: one per `CacheScope`,
built in the constructor, so `describe()` names every one at boot and
`get_cache` is a lookup. A scope is a name, not a connection, so
building them all costs nothing.

`make benchmark-boot` is the re-test. Run it when a root or a dependency
changes and compare with the table above. A change that moves a
constructor above a millisecond, or that opens a connection in one, is
a finding. The import floor moves only when a dependency is added or
dropped, and the same table shows it.
