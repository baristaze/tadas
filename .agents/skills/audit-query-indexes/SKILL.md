# audit-query-indexes

Every query the platform sends, the index that serves it, and what it
costs when the data is large. The costs are measured, not guessed: on a
database the run makes and seeds, under the same login, row-level
security policy, and scope the storage funnel uses.

## Input

`[--scale <n>] [--focus <namespace,...>] [--contention]`

`--scale` is the seed's, `1` by default (5,000 people, a team org of 200
members and 100,000 tasks, a million events, 50,000 work items); `0.01`
is a quick run with the same shape, whose times prove the wiring and
nothing about scale. `--focus` narrows the audit, the hot paths of step
5 included, to some namespaces (`tasks`, `events`, `work`, ...); every
namespace by default. `--contention` adds the measure of locks held
across round trips. The audit reads and runs the checkout, tools and
code alike; to audit another commit, run it from a checkout of that
commit that has `ops/audit/`. Every command runs from the repository
root.

## Role and credential

None, local only. The skill runs on the local stack (`make
infra-up`, with `make migrate` run once), in a database it makes, seeds,
and drops. It holds no cloud credential and reads no environment.

## Procedure

1. Name the run: `audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd>`, today's date in UTC.
   When `uv run python ops/audit/auditdb.py list` shows that name taken,
   another run holds it: add a suffix (`_2`), and never drop a database
   this run did not make. Make the evidence folder
   `~/Downloads/tadas_query_indexes_<yyyy-mm-dd>/` (`mkdir -p`). Say
   which commit the report read (`git rev-parse HEAD`).
2. List every statement. The storage impls are
   `om/src/tadas/om/<namespace>/storage/impl/postgres.py`; the indexes
   are in the table classes (`om/src/tadas/om/*/storage/tables/*.py`) and
   the migrations (`om/migrations/sql/<role>/`, newest last). For each
   statement note its caller and how often it runs: every request, every
   write, every creating POST, once per sweep pass per tenant, once per
   pass, or rare: grep each storage method's callers in the managers
   (`om/src/tadas/om/*/impl/`), the routers
   (`services/api/src/tadas/services/api/routers/`), and the worker
   (`workers/maintenance/src/tadas/workers/maintenance/`, whose sweep is
   `loop.py`), tests left out. A read by the primary key alone may be
   listed as `fine` without a plan; every other statement is measured.
3. Make and seed the run's database:

   ```bash
   uv run python ops/audit/auditdb.py create audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd>
   uv run python ops/audit/seed.py audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd> --scale <scale>
   uv run python ops/audit/explain.py reset audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd>
   ```

4. Measure every statement. Write them into
   `~/Downloads/tadas_query_indexes_<yyyy-mm-dd>/statements.sql` in the
   format and with the cases `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/statements.md` gives
   (read it before writing the file), then run (each statement opens its
   own connection, so a file may hold any number of generic plans):

   ```bash
   uv run python ops/audit/explain.py plans audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd> ~/Downloads/tadas_query_indexes_<yyyy-mm-dd>/statements.sql > ~/Downloads/tadas_query_indexes_<yyyy-mm-dd>/plans.txt
   ```

   A verdict per statement: `fine` (an index condition that stops at the
   page or the key), `risk` (linear in something that grows, but fine
   today), `gap` (reads far more than it returns where it runs often).
5. The hot paths. For each of the per-request baseline, the task lists,
   the event append, the queue claim, the outbox relay, and the sweep's
   pass, say what it costs and what grows it, from the plans and from the
   frequency of step 2. A per-tenant cost times the number of tenants is
   the sweep's; a lock held across round trips (the event cursor) caps a
   tenant's write rate. With `--contention`, measure those locks with the
   storage impls as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/statements.md` shows; without
   it, say they were not measured.
6. Read the inventory now, before any candidate adds scans: an index
   with no scans after step 4 serves no statement the audit measured;
   weigh it against the writes it costs.

   ```bash
   uv run python ops/audit/explain.py inventory audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd> > ~/Downloads/tadas_query_indexes_<yyyy-mm-dd>/inventory.md
   ```

7. Test each fix on the same data before proposing it. The before is
   step 4's plan. Create the
   candidate index on the run's database, measure the statements it
   serves again from a file of their own, and drop it before the next
   candidate, so each after is measured against the migrations' indexes
   plus that one:

   ```bash
   uv run python ops/audit/explain.py index audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd> "CREATE INDEX ix_try ON core.tasks (org_id, assignee_id, status) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL"
   uv run python ops/audit/explain.py plans audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd> ~/Downloads/tadas_query_indexes_<yyyy-mm-dd>/try_<n>.sql
   uv run python ops/audit/explain.py index audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd> "DROP INDEX core.ix_try"
   ```

   Say the before and the after, and whether the generic plan picks the
   index too (a partial index whose predicate names a bound value is
   one a generic plan cannot use). A candidate that does not help is a
   finding too: say why, as `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/statements.md` explains
   for a filter row-level security keeps out of the index condition.
8. Drop the run's database, whatever happened before:

   ```bash
   uv run python ops/audit/auditdb.py drop audit_query_indexes_<yyyymmdd>
   ```

9. Write the report, and the proposed tickets in it. The skill files
   none.

## What it never does

- Never writes to a shared database or to an environment: it logs in
  only to the database it made on the local stack, and drops it.
- Never modifies a tracked file, never commits, never opens a pull
  request: a tested index is a proposal with its numbers, not a
  migration.
- Never reports a time from a scale it did not seed as measured: a larger
  scale is an extrapolation, and the report says so.

## Output

`~/Downloads/tadas_query_indexes_<yyyy-mm-dd>.md`:

# Tadas: query patterns, indexes, and load

Commit <sha> (code and tools). Seed: scale <n> (<the counts seed.py printed>). Postgres <version>, local.

## The answer

<one paragraph: mostly fine or not, the gaps by place, the top three by impact>

## How it was measured

## Every query

### <namespace> (`<storage impl path>`)

| Table | Query shape | Caller, frequency | Index | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Hot paths and contention

## Recommendations, by impact

1. **<fix>.** Evidence: <before → after, on this seed>. Change: <SQL>.
   Effort S/M/L. Needed: <now, or at what scale>. Proposed ticket: <title>.

## Redundant or unused indexes

## What I could not verify
