# The fold

A fold replaces a role's migration chain with one revision. It holds the
head's schema under the head's revision id, so a database at the head
has nothing to apply, and a reader finds the schema in one file. No
applied file is edited: the chain's files go, and one pair takes their
place. A role whose chain is one revision is folded already.

`<compose>` below is the Makefile's compose command: `docker compose
--env-file .env.example --env-file .env -f
deployment/local/docker-compose.yml`, with `--env-file .env` left out
when the tree has no `.env`. `<day>` is today's date in UTC,
`yyyymmdd`, and `<evidence>` is
`~/Downloads/tadas_docs_compact_<yyyy-mm-dd>`.

## The precondition

Every database that exists is at its chain's head. Read each part, and
stop the fold at the first that fails or cannot be read: the chain
stays as it is, and the report says which part.

1. The heads, one line per role:

   ```bash
   uv run --package tadas-om python -c "from tadas.om.storage.migrate import head; from tadas.om.storage.roles import DatabaseRole; [print(r.value, head(r)) for r in DatabaseRole]"
   ```

2. The newest migration's commit: `git log -1 --format=%H origin/<main>
   -- om/migrations/sql om/migrations/versions`.
3. Each environment `deployment/cloud/environments.json` names has
   deployed that commit or a later one. The deploy migrates before it
   rolls out, so its database is then at the head.
   - Staging: the commit of the newest `deploy-staging` run on the main
     branch that succeeded and whose apply job succeeded, read as
     `release.yml` reads it. A run's `headSha` is the branch's tip when
     the run started, never the commit it deployed: that commit is the
     last word of the run's title.

     ```bash
     gh run list --workflow deploy-staging.yml --branch <main> --status success --limit 30 --json databaseId --jq '.[].databaseId'
     gh run view <run> --json jobs --jq '[.jobs[] | select(.name == "plan and apply staging, migrate, and publish") | .conclusion] | first // ""'
     gh run view <run> --json displayTitle --jq '.displayTitle'
     ```

     Take the runs in the order the first command lists them, newest
     first, at most 30. The first whose second command prints `success`
     is the one; a run where the cloud was not configured succeeds with
     that job skipped, and does not count. When none of the 30 has
     applied and staging has deployed, as this part's last line reads
     it, its commit cannot be read.
   - Production, when it has deployed (this part's last line): the tip
     of `origin/release`, when `gh api
     repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<tip>/statuses --jq '[.[] |
     select(.context == "released/production")] | first | .state'`
     prints `success`.
   - For each: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <newest migration's commit>
     <deployed commit>` exits 0.
   - An environment that never deployed has no database, and passes.
     It is read from the deploys, never from a branch: an
     `origin/release` no deploy applied is no production. Staging never
     deployed when the same list without `--status success` is empty,
     or the second command prints `skipped` for every run in it.
     Production never deployed when its list is empty, or its apply job
     ran in none of its runs, the command printing `skipped` or
     nothing:

     ```bash
     gh run list --workflow deploy-production.yml --limit 30 --json databaseId --jq '.[].databaseId'
     gh run view <run> --json jobs --jq '[.jobs[] | select(.name == "apply the approved plan, migrate, and publish") | .conclusion] | first // ""'
     ```

     A `gh` call that fails does not pass.
4. The local database: for every role, `make migrate` prints
   `<role>: upgraded to <head>`.

An expand and contract in flight does not stop a fold. The fold holds
the head's schema whole, so a column, a default, or a trigger kept for
the release before stays in it, and the contract step comes later, as a
revision on the fold.

## The steps

1. **Dump the chain.** Before any file changes, make a database from
   the chain and dump each role that has more than one revision:

   ```bash
   uv run python ops/audit/auditdb.py create audit_fold_chain_<day>
   <compose> exec -T postgres pg_dump -U postgres -d audit_fold_chain_<day> --schema-only --schema=<role> --restrict-key=fold > <evidence>/chain.<role>.sql
   ```

   When `auditdb.py list` shows the name taken, another run holds it:
   add a suffix (`_2`), and never drop a database this run did not make.
2. **Write the fold**, for each such role. The revision id is the head's
   (part 1), whole, a suffix included.
   - `om/migrations/sql/<role>/<head id>_the_<role>_role.up.sql`: the
     schema as `chain.<role>.sql` has it, written as the chain's own
     files are: a comment that says what the role holds, every name
     schema-qualified, each table with its columns in the dump's order
     (a column a later step added sits where the dump has it), then its
     constraints, indexes, and policies, and each function or trigger
     the head still has. It ends as the chain's first step does, with
     the role-wide grants and default privileges of the serving logins
     and the revoke on the role's `alembic_version`: the dump compares
     them. No `SET`, no `OWNER TO`, and no `CREATE` of
     `alembic_version`: the runner makes that table.
   - No data statement: a backfill leaves with the step it belonged to,
     since a database at the head has run it and a new one has no row to
     fill. A row every new database must hold, which the code reads and
     never writes, stays, and the report lists it.
   - `<head id>_the_<role>_role.down.sql`: drops what the up file
     makes, grants first.
   - `om/migrations/versions/<role>/<head id>_the_<role>_role.py`: the
     wrapper, as the chain's are, with `revision = "<head id>"` and
     `down_revision = None`.
   - Every other file of the role's chain goes: `git rm`.
3. **Move what named a step.** `git grep -n` each removed stamp and each
   removed file name.
   - A test goes only when it pins a revision id the fold removes, or
     tests a backfill the fold removes. Every other test stays, the
     head's downgrade and upgrade, the ORM-against-schema check, and
     the test of `backfill` over two tenants' rows among them.
   - A test that goes may also assert what the head keeps: a trigger of
     an expand and contract in flight, a constraint, a policy. Those
     assertions stay, in a test that migrates to the head and names no
     step; only the pin and the steps go.
   - A test that steps down from the head (`downgrade` to `-1`) now
     empties the role: the fold is the chain's one revision, so its
     down file drops every table. Such a test stays when it upgrades to
     the head again before it returns, on its failure path too. One
     that leaves the role a step down for a fixture or a later test is
     changed to upgrade first, or the suite fails after it.
   - An ADR, a comment, or a document that cites a removed revision or
     file names the fold's file, or drops the citation when it named a
     step and not the schema.
   - A checker exception whose `path` is a removed migration file
     (`[[tool.arch-check.exception]]` in `pyproject.toml`) names the
     fold's file when the fold still holds what it allows, and goes when
     it does not.
   - An entry of `DROPPED_TABLE_ROLES` in
     `om/src/tadas/om/storage/roles.py` names a table only a removed
     step named. It is code: leave it, and list it in the report.
   - `deployment/migration-inputs.json` covers the fold's files by
     pattern, so it does not change. The fingerprint does: the next
     deploy of each environment runs the migrate task once, which finds
     its database at the head and applies nothing.
4. **Prove it.** Make a database from the fold and dump it the same way:

   ```bash
   uv run python ops/audit/auditdb.py create audit_fold_folded_<day>
   <compose> exec -T postgres pg_dump -U postgres -d audit_fold_folded_<day> --schema-only --schema=<role> --restrict-key=fold > <evidence>/fold.<role>.sql
   diff <evidence>/chain.<role>.sql <evidence>/fold.<role>.sql
   ```

   `diff` prints nothing, for every role. When it prints a difference,
   correct the fold's SQL, drop `audit_fold_folded_<day>`, and prove it
   anew: the first run plus at most 3 reruns. Then stop, undo the fold,
   and report the difference. The undo returns the tree to its last
   commit: `git restore --staged --worktree .`, then `git clean -f
   om/migrations` for the files the fold added.
5. **A database at the old head has nothing to apply.** The chain's
   database is one. Run the fold's migrate and its check on it:

   ```bash
   uv run python -c "import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'ops/audit'); import auditdb; from tadas.om.storage import migrate; os.environ.update(auditdb.urls('audit_fold_chain_<day>')); sys.exit(migrate.main(['upgrade', '--all', '--local']) or migrate.main(['check', '--all', '--local']))"
   ```

   It prints `<role>: upgraded to <head id>` and then `<role>: in sync`
   for every role, and exits 0. Dump each folded role once more, into
   `<evidence>/after.<role>.sql`: `diff` against `chain.<role>.sql`
   prints nothing. When either fails, stop and undo the fold as step 4
   says.
6. **Drop both databases**, whatever happened before:

   ```bash
   uv run python ops/audit/auditdb.py drop audit_fold_chain_<day>
   uv run python ops/audit/auditdb.py drop audit_fold_folded_<day>
   ```

7. **Commit the fold alone**: the subject `Each migration chain is one
   revision at its head`, and in the body, per role, the head id, the
   count of revisions folded, the backfills left out, the tests that
   went, the citations that moved, and the line `<role>: the schema
   dump of the chain equals the fold's`. The dumps stay in the evidence
   folder, so the commit's body is where a review finds the comparison
   (STO-24). Note the commit before it: the report names it as the last
   one whose chain reaches the head from an older revision.

## What the report says of it

- Per role: the head id, the revisions folded, the backfills left out,
  and that the three dumps are equal.
- The last commit before the fold. A snapshot taken at an older
  revision is restored at that commit's release, which migrates it to
  the head, and then moves to the current release.
- A developer's local database behind the head is made anew (`make
  reset`); one at the head needs nothing.
