"""The orchestrations swimlane: long-running records, each a status and a
cursor advanced one step at a time by whichever worker holds its work item.

This namespace is the mechanism, the same for every kind: the record, its
start, its failure, and the two ways a parked record wakes (the event that
clears its reason, or a person). What one step of a kind does is the
namespace whose rows it changes: the tasks namespace steps an import and a
cleanup, and lands the record beside its own rows (`Step`), a park among
them."""
