"""A long-running orchestration: work that takes minutes, kept as a durable
record with a status and a cursor, and advanced one step at a time by
whichever worker holds its work item. The claim lives on the work item, never
on the record, so a worker that dies leaves the record at its last committed
step and the next claim goes on from there.

A record has three outcomes. It succeeds, it fails, or it parks. A park
stops the work with a reason and keeps everything the record achieved; the
event that clears the reason, or a person, wakes it. A guard parks; only a
bound fails. An error that is neither (a database or a store that did not
answer) is the work queue's to retry: the item comes back with a growing
delay, and the step starts again at the cursor the last commit left."""
