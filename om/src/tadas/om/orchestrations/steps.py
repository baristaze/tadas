    how a wake staggers the steps it resumes.

    A park that knows when its reason may clear passes `wake_at`: a step that
    reads a provider's outage parks on `provider_unavailable` until the
    outage's retry time. The park lands a `WAKE_PARKED` row for the org's
    records parked for the reason, waiting in the queue until then. Every
    record that read the same mark names the same time, and the work queue
    lands their rows as one item, which resumes them staggered; each woken
    record asks its guard again.

    The work row asks as the person who started the record, whoever wrote
    this step: a step woken by the platform or an operator still runs as the
    person who asked for the work, so what it makes is theirs, and their
