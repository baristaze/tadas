    statement that writes them, and holds the lock to its commit, so two
    appends to one tenant queue here, commit in the order of their numbers,
    and a rollback returns the numbers.
    The same row is the tenant's head seq, the number every pong carries.

    `floor` is the highest seq the trim removed, 0 while it removed none. The
    trim moves it in the transaction that deletes up to it, under this row's
    lock, so every event in `(floor, head]` is stored whenever a reader looks."""
