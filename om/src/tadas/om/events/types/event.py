"""Every push is also a record. An event names the record that changed and
carries the tenant's sequence number, so a client that reconnects asks for
everything after the last one it saw. The relay of the outbox appends it
under the row's id, so relaying twice appends once. An audit entry is the
same shape: the principal and the app are on every row."""
