"""The transactional outbox: a handoff that follows a core write (the event
row behind every push, the work item a write starts) is never a second
statement a manager remembers to make. The manager writes the core row and
the `OutboxRow`s that announce it in one named atomic storage method, then
relays each at once (in the API, once the request's answer is sent); the
maintenance sweep claims whatever a crash or a dropped message left behind,
one attempt at a time with a growing
delay, fails a row whose attempts are spent (a dead letter), and purges what
is settled. The relay is idempotent on the row's id, so relaying twice is
harmless."""
