# Leases

A thing one holder may use at a time, such as a loading dock, leased
under a fencing token, with a line in front of it. This is one of the
kinds of thing [Tadas is made of](../../../../README.md).

## What it holds

- **Resource**: one leasable thing of an org. It stands for a row of
  another namespace, by a registered kind and that row's id, and it is
  unique by the three. It carries labels, up to 160 of up to 200
  characters of free text that say what it offers; its bound on one
  lease, up to seven days; its availability; and the anchor: the
  highest token granted on it, the lease that holds it, and until when.
- **Kind**: what the resource is, with the shape of what an ask for it
  carries and its hooks: what a grant starts, and whether a request may
  still be granted. What a grant starts holds one job at most: a work
  item that lands in the grant's commit. The core has one kind, `noop`,
  whose grant starts nothing. A product replaces it with its own kinds.
- **Lease**: one grant of one resource to one principal, under a token
  one above every earlier grant of that resource. When its grant starts
  a job, it names the job's work item, and when the job started. It is
  active, then released, expired, or revoked.
- **Request**: a principal's place in line. It names one resource, or a
  selector: a kind and the labels it needs. It carries its ask's key,
  how long it may wait, its term, the window its job has to start in, a
  rank, and what waits on it, by a registered
  waiter kind and an id. It is waiting, then granted, cancelled with a
  reason, or expired.
- **Line**: a resource's line is the waiting requests that name it,
  and the waiting selector requests it matches, in the org's one rank
  order.

## What can happen

- **Register** a resource with its owner's row, in the same commit, and
  **retire** it with that row: the requests that name it leave their
  line as `retired`, and its lease is never renewed.
- **Ask.** A request joins the end of the line, and every free resource
  it may take is offered at once. A direct ask is granted only when no
  one waits in front of it. An ask asked again by its key answers its
  lease or its place.
- **Grant.** A resource that frees goes to the head of its line: on a
  release, a revocation, an expiry, or its availability back.
- **Renew** and **release**, by the holder, or by the worker that holds
  the claim on the lease's job. A renewal runs the length it names, or
  the term again, within the bound. A lease past its expiry is never
  renewed.
- **Start**, by the job's worker. A grant that starts a job runs the
  lease to the end of the window the job has to start in. The start
  runs it the full term from then, and lands until that window and the
  skew margin have passed; past them, the lease lapses.
- **Cancel** a request, by its asker or a manager; **reorder** one, and
  **revoke** a lease, by a manager.
- **Leave.** A waiter that ends leaves every line.
- **Sweep.** A pass ends each lease past its expiry and the skew
  margin, expires each request past its wait, and offers each free
  resource to its line. An ended lease and a settled request go thirty
  days later.

## The rules

- **One holder, by two fences.** A grant locks the anchor's row and
  lands only while the anchor still holds the token it read and no live
  lease. A unique index over a resource's active leases is the second
  fence.
- **The job's worker acts for the holder.** It presents the lease's
  token and its claim on the job, which the queue's own fence reads
  live, so a worker the queue took the item back from is refused. No
  one else gains a right, and no route carries a claim.
- **A token only grows.** Whatever acts on the resource for the holder
  presents the token, and that side refuses one lower than the highest
  it has seen. The client's fence does this for a holder.
- **The margin outlasts a slow clock.** A lease ends only once its
  expiry and the margin have passed, so a holder whose clock runs slow
  has stopped before the resource is granted again.
- **One request, one lease.** A selector request stands in many lines
  with one place, and the first resource that frees grants it.
- **No grant to no one.** A grant asks the waiter whether it still
  waits, and the kind whether the request may still be granted. A no
  cancels the request, and the next in line is offered.
- **A waiter is told in the grant's commit.** The rows that wake it and
  the rows the kind starts land with the lease.

## How another namespace composes it

A product adds a kind to `ResourceKind` and the shape of its ask to
`ASK_PAYLOADS`, and registers a `ResourceKindInterface` impl for it at
the root. Its owner writes the resource with its own row through
`register_statement` (or `land_resource` in memory), and retires it
through `retire_statement`. A thing that waits adds a `WaiterKind`
with a `WaiterInterface` impl. An orchestration waits as the core's
waiter: its step asks with `park`, and parks on `resource` until the
grant wakes it, or its request's end without a lease does. Per-lease facts of a product's own live in its own
table, keyed by the lease's id
([ADR 0086](../../../../../docs/adr/0086-a-scarce-resource-is-leased-under-a-fencing-token.md)).
A kind whose grant starts a job returns its work row among its grant
rows, and the job's handler starts the lease, renews it, and releases
it
([ADR 0094](../../../../../docs/adr/0094-a-lease-is-kept-by-the-worker-that-runs-its-job.md)).
