"""The hooks a kind registers, as a work kind registers its handler. A
resource kind says what a grant of it starts and whether a request may still
be granted; a waiter kind says whether a waiter still waits and what wakes
it. The root hands the manager one impl per kind, and a kind with none is
refused at the ask."""
