"""The leases swimlane: a scarce resource, leased to one holder at a time
under a fencing token, with a line in front of it.

A resource stands for a row of another namespace by its kind and id. A
request names one resource, or a selector, and waits in line; a grant is a
side effect of a resource freeing (a release, an expiry, a revocation, or
its availability back) and goes to the head of its line, decided under the
anchor's lock. The holder renews its lease and releases it; the sweep ends
one past its expiry and the skew margin."""
