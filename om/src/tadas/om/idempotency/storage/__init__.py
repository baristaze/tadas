"""Storage of idempotency records. The scope is user-bound within the
tenant: both keys are passed and both are in every WHERE clause. The writes
that move a pending record (take over, re-arm, finish, release) are
conditional in the statement itself and report what they matched: a
take-over, a re-arm, and a finish return the record as written or None, a
release returns whether the attempt went. The pending lease is passed as a
token bound (see `types/attempt.py`) and never as a clock, and no write here
touches the birth time. Nothing here raises for a refused attempt; the
