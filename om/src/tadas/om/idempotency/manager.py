"""The idempotency swimlane: the durable outcome of a request the caller
may retry. The gateway begins a record before it runs a creating request
and finishes it with the outcome; a retry gets the stored record back. The
record names the attempt that holds it, and finish and release are that
attempt's alone: an attempt that ran past the pending lease and lost the
marker to a retry is refused, like a worker whose lease has passed. A
failure releases the attempt and keeps the record, so the retry reruns on
the id the record carries and a row the failed attempt left behind is found,
not repeated."""
