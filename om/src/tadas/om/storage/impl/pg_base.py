        role's statement deadline from the moment it opens, so no statement
        here asks for one.

        This is the funnel: every statement of every impl passes here, so the
        tenant is named once per transaction and not once per query. `org_id`
        is required; `EMPTY_UUID` is the system scope, the transaction that
        reads across tenants, and it is never a default. `user_id` narrows a
        `both`-scoped table that names the user to one person, and
        `identity_id` narrows one whose person is the identity behind it
        (`users`) and is the person of an `identity`-scoped table.

        The system scope runs on the system login's pool and every other
        scope on the runtime login's. The policies admit the system scope to
        the system login alone, so a runtime connection that names
        `EMPTY_UUID` reads nothing.

        The settings go out in the message that begins the transaction, so

        second transaction opens a second session.

        entity change is one row; a write that also starts work carries a second
        row of kind `work.<kind>` in the same tuple, because the queue is a role
        of its own and no statement reaches both.

        A write never brings a soft-deleted row back. Every update here is a
