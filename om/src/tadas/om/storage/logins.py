"""The three database logins, by name, and the one command that makes them.

None of the three is a superuser or carries BYPASSRLS, since either walks past
every row-level security policy and the policies are the second fence.

- The migration login owns every schema and table. It runs the migrations in
  the deploy's one-off task, and no process holds it otherwise.
- The runtime login is what every request's connection uses. It owns nothing
  and holds SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, so it cannot drop a policy,
  turn FORCE off, or alter a table, whatever statement reaches it.
- The system login is the runtime login's twin for the system scope. The
  listed system-scope methods run under it, on a pool of their own, and the
  policies admit the system scope to it alone.

The policies name the logins, so the names are fixed here and a URL that
names another login is refused rather than followed.

`ensure_logins` runs as the master: the cloud's master user, or `tadas`
locally. It is idempotent. A second run finds every login, schema, owner, and
grant already in place and changes nothing but the passwords, which it sets
from the URLs again.
