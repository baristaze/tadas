"""The platform's size, what the first responder to an alarm reads before it
escalates: an alarm on a platform of one tenant and one user is the
developer at work.

A read model. The maintenance worker's sweep counts it across every tenant
and keeps the latest count as the platform's one tally row, in the `admin`
role; the operator plane reads that row and never counts (ADR 0074). The
row is derived, and the next count rebuilds it."""
