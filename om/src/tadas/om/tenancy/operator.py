"""The operator plane of the tenancy swimlane: what a platform operator may
do across every tenant. Every operation takes `OperatorContext` and nothing
else; the tenant manager takes `OpContext` and nothing else, so the type
system keeps the two planes apart. A read requires `OperatorPermission.READ`
and a write `OperatorPermission.WRITE`, which the allowlist entry grants.

A read of a tenant's rows names the tenant, reads them through that
namespace's storage under the named tenant, and is logged with the tenant
and the operator, so support access has a trail. The creates are the same
creates the seeding commands run: one implementation, two entry points."""
