# Tenancy

The org, the people in it, and the credentials they hold. This is one
of the seven kinds of thing [Tadas is made of](../../../../README.md).

## The nouns

- **Org**: a name, a slug (the short handle that names the org in a
  URL), and a kind. The slug is unique among living orgs. An org is
  personal or team. Every person has exactly one **personal org**, made
  with them: their place to work from the first moment, with a name and
  a slug made for them. Every other org is a **team org**, made on
  purpose. A personal org is otherwise an ordinary org: anyone may be
  added to it, and it holds tasks the way a team org does. An org that
  invites people or sets up single sign-on also has an organization at
  the identity provider, made the first time it is needed.
- **Identity**: one person across every org: an email, the identity
  provider's name for them (an issuer and a subject), and whether the
  person is on the operator allowlist and what an operator may do there
  (read, or write, which includes read), and the person's time zone.
  Tadas keeps no password.
- **User**: the identity inside one org: the display name and the
  email the team sees.
- **Membership**: the user's place in the org, with a role.
- **Invitation**: a person asked to join an org, by email, with a
  role. The identity provider sends the email with the link; the
  invitation says who asked, the role, and whether it is pending,
  accepted, or revoked. A link stops working at its expiry.
- **Session**: a signed-in visit. A login is a session with no org
  yet, the one a sign-in produces; exchanging it for an org gives a
  session in that org, and ends the login. A live session also proves
  who the person is, so it can list their orgs and be exchanged for a
  session in another one. A session ends at its absolute lifetime or after it sits idle,
  whichever comes first. Only the hash of the token is kept.
- **Second factor**: an operator's TOTP secret, sealed under a key the
  process holds, enrolled once it is confirmed by a first code.
- **Operator token**: an agent's credential for the operator plane.
  One permission, an hour at most, kept as its hash, and good for the
  operator plane alone.
- **API key**: a named, expiring credential for a program, with a
  role. Only the hash is kept; the key is shown once.
- **Socket ticket**: a single-use, short-lived pass for the live
  channel, standing for the session or the API key that asked for it.

## What can happen

- **Sign in.** A person signs in at the identity provider (WorkOS
  AuthKit: an email code or link, Google, GitHub, or their org's single
  sign-on) and comes back with a code, which the API exchanges there,
  server-side. The provider vouches for an issuer, a subject, and an
  email it has verified; an address it has not verified is refused. The
  identity is found by the issuer and the subject; else by the email,
  and linked from then on; else it is made. The answer is a login that
  lists the orgs the person belongs to, their personal org among them,
  and the login is exchanged for a session in one of them. A person an
  older release made without a personal org gets it at this sign-in.
- **Sign up.** There is no separate sign-up: a person nobody knows
  signs up by signing in. The identity, their personal org, their user
  in it, and the owner membership land together (`create_person`). The
  personal org is named after the person and its slug is generated
  from that name with a random tail.
- **Sign in from the command line.** A terminal has no browser to come
  back to, so it asks for a device sign-in: the person confirms a short
  code at the provider's address, in any browser, and the terminal,
  asking every few seconds, gets the login.
- **Confirm the second factor.** An operator with a second factor
  presents their login and the code from their authenticator, and gets
  a new login that records it; the operator plane asks for that one. A
  run of wrong codes for one email makes the next one wait.
- **Sign in locally.** On a developer's machine and in the tests, a
  person signs in by their address alone, and is made the first time,
  for the seed, the demos, and the traffic generator. A deployed
  environment refuses to start with it on.
- **Create a team org.** A signed-in person names an org, and a slug
  if they want one; otherwise the slug is made from the name. The org,
  their user in it under the name they carry where they are, and the
  owner membership land together, and the answer is their place in it.
  They move there with the switch below. Only a session creates an org;
  an api key is a program's and belongs to its tenant.
- **List my orgs, and switch.** A login or a live session lists the
  orgs the person belongs to, a page at a time. Exchanging a live
  session for another org is a switch: the session presented ends in
  the same step that issues the new one, so a person holds one session
  per tab.
- **Sign out.** The session presented is revoked. A session that came
  from a sign-in through the provider's hosted page also names the
  provider's own session in that browser, and the sign-out answers the
  provider's logout address for it: the browser goes there, the
  provider ends its session, and it sends the browser back to the
  portal's page that says so. Without that, the next sign-in on the same
  browser would let the same person straight back in, which a shared
  computer must not. A session from the device sign-in or the local
  sign-in has nothing there to end, and signs out of Tadas alone. A
  person can also list their own live sessions in the org and revoke any
  one of them.
- **Read and change the profile.** The org, the person's own identity,
  and their display name. The email belongs to the identity.
- **Invite.** An owner or an admin invites a person by email, with a
  role no higher than their own; the provider sends the email with the
  link. A person who is a member already, or whose address has an open
  invitation, is refused; an expired one is replaced. Signing in
  through the link makes the person a member with that role. Pending
  invitations are listed a page at a time, sent again with a fresh
  expiry, or revoked. This is how a person joins an org in a deployed
  environment, and the one place a limit on an org's members is
  checked.
- **Set up single sign-on.** An owner or an admin of a team org opens
  the identity provider's admin portal from the org's settings and
  connects their company's identity provider there, or proves the org's
  domain. A sign-in through that single sign-on makes the person a
  member when their address is in a domain the org verified; anyone
  else joins by invitation. A personal org has no single sign-on.
- **Manage members.** List the members a page at a time, change a
  member's role, or remove a member. Removing ends the membership,
  hides the user from every list, and revokes their sessions and API
  keys, all in one step, and announces each revocation so their
  sockets close. A failure lands none of it.
- **Manage API keys.** Create one with a name, a role, and a lifetime
  of at most ninety days; list them (a member manager sees the org's,
  everyone else their own); revoke one. An org on a plan without API
  keys is refused the first one, and a key it already has is kept and
  refused while it is on that plan ([billing](../billing/README.md)).
- **Open the live channel.** Issue a socket ticket; redeem it once.
- **Seed an environment.** Create an org with its first owner, or add
  a person to an org. Both are the platform's own operations, run by
  `make seed` on a local environment; a deployed one is joined by
  invitation. A person either one makes who did not exist before comes
  with their personal org, in the same commit, and signs in with the
  address.
  The seeding is the platform arranging a laptop, not a tenant adding
  someone, so it is not bound by the org's seats, and it grants the
  seeded team Team. An invitation, and a join through the org's single
  sign-on, take a seat like any other door: an invitation past the seats
  is refused before it is sent, and one accepted when the seats have
  filled meanwhile stays pending while the sign-in goes on.
- **Operate across orgs.** An operator, admitted from the allowlist,
  can create an org with its owner, add a member (bound by the org's
  seats like any other door), read an org, its
  members, its tasks, and its events, read the platform's size, list
  every org, and delete a team org. A personal org is never deleted.
  A deleted org keeps its row as the record; everything else of it is
  purged once the retention has passed, and once nothing is left the
  org is marked purged and the sweep stops visiting it.
- **Grant an operator.** The grant job puts an identity on the
  allowlist, takes it off, or mints the operator token of the
  provisioner or the smoke identity. Each change of the allowlist is
  audited. The platform's own identities live in a reserved domain,
  which a sign-in refuses, and the first grant makes them.
- **Enrol a second factor.** An allowlisted person's first sign-in to
  the operator plane reaches two calls and nothing else: mint the
  secret, then confirm it with a first code. From then on the plane
  admits them only on a sign-in that verified a code.
- **Record a time zone.** A person's time zone is an IANA name, like
  `Europe/Istanbul`, kept on their identity, so it holds in every org
  they are in. The portal sends the one the browser reports when the
  person signs in. A task's reminder goes out at nine in the morning
  there ([tasks](../tasks/README.md)). Anything that is not such a name,
  an offset like `+03:00` among them, is refused.
- **Sweep.** Removed members, revoked or expired keys, expired
  sessions, closed or expired invitations, and old runs of wrong
  second-factor codes are deleted for good
  after the retention, thirty days by default; a revoked session goes
  once it has expired too, within its twelve hours. A socket ticket,
  which lives a minute, is deleted a day after it expired. Erasing a
  person is this purge: the events of this namespace carry ids and
  never a value.

## The rules

- **The role ladder.** Viewer, member, admin, owner, in that order. A
  viewer reads. A member also writes and manages their own keys. An
  admin and an owner also manage members and the org's plan. The owner ranks above the
  admin although they hold the same permissions today, because the
  owner is the founder and not a permission set.
- **Nothing is issued above the issuer.** An API key's role and a
  granted or changed membership's role are capped at the caller's own
  role. The service role, which the platform's own work runs under, is
  no rung of the ladder: nothing a person mints may carry it.
- **A key never mints a key.** Only a session creates an API key, so
  revoking a leaked key ends every access it gave.
- **Unique among the living.** One slug per living org, one personal
  org per identity, one user per identity in an org, one membership per
  user in an org, one identity per subject of an issuer, one pending
  invitation per address in an org. Removing a member or deleting an org frees the name
  for reuse.
- **A personal org stays its person's.** It is not deleted, and its
  person is not removed from it and does not change role in it, so it
  never changes hands. Nobody leaves an org by removing themselves, in
  any org. Everyone else in a personal org is an ordinary member.
- **Secrets are fingerprints.** A session token, an API key, and a
  socket ticket are stored as hashes. The plain value is shown once.
- **A ticket works once.** A second redemption is refused.
- **A sign-in is exchanged once.** The exchange ends the login in the
  same write that makes the session, so one sign-in makes one session.
  A second exchange, a replay, or a retry after a lost answer is
  refused, and the person signs in again; of two at once, one lands.
  The exchange takes no idempotency key: the login is the key, and a
  replayed answer could not carry the session's token
  ([ADR 0037](../../../../../docs/adr/0037-a-sign-in-is-exchanged-once.md)).
- **A verified address or nothing.** The identity provider's sign-in
  counts only with an address it verified; that is what links a person
  Tadas already knows to the provider's name for them.
- **The operator plane takes a second factor or a token.** A session
  proves the person, but it is a tenant's credential, and the operator
  plane refuses it. A person's sign-in admits only when it verified a
  TOTP code; an agent presents an operator token, minted by an
  operator signed in with a code or by the grant job. A token never
  mints a token and never enters a tenant.
- **A code works once.** A TOTP code accepted once is refused after,
  even inside its thirty seconds.
- **A gone org refuses its logins.** Exchanging a login for an org
  that is deleted, or a membership that has ended, is refused as not
  authorized; the login itself still stands.
- **Another org's things do not exist.** A user or a membership that
  belongs to another org is answered exactly like one that never
  existed.
