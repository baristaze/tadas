"""The digest a sign-in looks an identity up by (`rules.email_digest`),
computed by the database from the stored address, folded, so every writer,
an older release included, leaves a row the lookup finds, and two spellings
of one address meet the unique index (ADR 0072). A generated column takes
only immutable functions. `lower` under the builtin `pg_unicode_fast`
collation is Unicode's full mapping whatever the database's locale, the one
`rules.fold_email` applies. `decode(..., 'escape')` is the immutable
function that yields the address's UTF-8 bytes; it reads a backslash as an
escape, which is why an address holds none (`rules.check_email`)."""
