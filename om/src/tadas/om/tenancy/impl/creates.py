"""The creates the tenancy namespace has more than one entry point for: a
person with their personal org, an org with its owner, and a member of an
org. The seeding commands (`bootstrap`, `add-member`) reach them through the
tenant manager's transitions, under a request stage; the operator plane
reaches them through the operator manager, under an operator; a first
sign-in reaches the first one with a person nobody has seen before, an
accepted invitation reaches the third, and a signed-in person reaches the
second one for a team org of their own. Every path builds
the same rows and lands them in the same named atomic write, so a tenant
seeded from the command line, one created over the operator API, and one a
person made are indistinguishable afterwards. Nothing here constructs a stage
or decides who may call: the callers authorize, this module verifies, copies,
and writes.

A person never exists without a place to work: every path that makes an
identity lands its personal org, its user there, and the owner membership in
the same commit as the identity (`personal_rows`). The one exception is the
platform's own identities, which the grant job makes and no person signs in
as."""
