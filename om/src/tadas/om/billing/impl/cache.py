"""The org's billing account, cached per org under the tenant's generation.

The key of a cached account carries the org's generation, a counter in the
same scope. Every write of the account bumps that counter with one
`increment` after its commit, so the entry a read cached before the write
is orphaned at once and expires by its TTL. The TTL is the backstop: a bump
that does not land leaves the old entry readable until then, and never
longer.

The cache fails open. A miss, an entry this build cannot read, and a Valkey
that cannot be reached are each a read of storage. Only the account is
cached; what the caller may see of it is decided above this, on every call.
