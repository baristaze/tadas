"""The context an operation takes first, in two orthogonal ideas.

Stages are concrete frozen types, one per amount of evidence a request has
gathered: `RequestContext` (a request exists), `IdentityContext` (a person
is verified), `OpContext` (a membership is established), `OperatorContext`
(an operator is admitted). A subclass is a refinement, so every stage is
accepted where a weaker one is asked for. A stage above the request stage
is produced only by a transition, an operation of the tenancy manager or
one that asks it, as the worker's claim does, and nowhere else; a function
that takes a stage relies on its invariant instead of re-checking it.

Scopes are structural views (`Protocol`) over what a stage carries:
`RequestScope`, `TenantScope`, `ActorScope`, `CredentialScope`, and the one
named composition, `ProvenanceScope`. A function that reads only a few
fields declares the scope it reads, and its callers keep passing the stage
they hold.

Roles, permissions, credential kinds, and app types are declared here, so
this module imports nothing above `base.py` and the tenancy namespace reads
them rather than the other way round."""
