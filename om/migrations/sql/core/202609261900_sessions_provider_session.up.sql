-- The identity provider's own session behind a Tadas session: the sign-out
-- ends it too. Expand only: the column is nullable, and the release before
-- this one neither reads nor writes it, so it keeps working on it while a
-- rollout runs both. A row that release writes carries none, and its
-- sign-out ends Tadas's session alone, as it did. Nothing is contracted.
