-- Every person gets their personal org: the org, their user in it, and the
-- owner membership, the rows `creates.personal_rows` builds. A person is every
-- identity but the platform's own (the reserved domain of
-- `rules.PLATFORM_EMAIL_DOMAIN`, which no person signs in as) and but one
-- already in as many orgs as a person may join (the managers' default bound
-- of 100), where one more place would make every read of their places refuse.
-- The org is named after the person's name where they gave one (their first
-- live user's) or "Personal", the slug is that name with a tail from the
-- identity's id, and the rows are the person's own: the provenance names the
-- new user, as a sign-up's does. The ids are minted here, since a data
-- migration has no object model above it.
--
-- Idempotent: it selects only people without a living personal org, so a
-- rerun finds nobody. Bounded: one pass takes at most 50000 people into a
-- temporary table and inserts from it in three statements; the last
-- statement refuses a pass that left anyone behind, and the whole
-- transaction rolls back, the fence included.
--
-- A migration names no tenant and FORCE binds the login that owns the
-- tables, so the fence is lifted for these statements and put back after.
-- Under the fence the reads of the orgs and the users would see nothing and
-- the inserts would be refused; the fence is never half on.
