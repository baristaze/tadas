-- The media swimlane: one row per file a tenant keeps in the object store,
-- a reference and never the bytes. A subject's files are read by id, the
-- sweep reads the deleted rows and the abandoned uploads, and the usage sums
-- the live rows; each read leads with org_id, so org_id gets no index of its
-- own. The size is a bigint because a sum of sizes is.
