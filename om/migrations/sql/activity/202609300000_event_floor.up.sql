-- The floor is the highest seq the trim has removed from a tenant's stream,
-- 0 while it has removed none. Every event above it, up to the head, is
-- stored. A read that starts below it is refused, because the events it
-- asks for are gone (ADR 0039).

-- Expand-only. The release before inserts a cursor row naming `org_id` and
-- `head`, and the default fills the floor.

-- not a BRIN: the trim frees pages at the bottom of the heap, new events
-- land there, and the physical order stops following the time.
