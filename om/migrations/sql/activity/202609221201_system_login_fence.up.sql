-- The system scope belongs to the system login. Every policy spelled the
-- system scope as the empty UUID alone, and any session may write a setting,
-- so a statement injected into a request could name it and read across
-- tenants. The clause now also names the login: the runtime login naming the
-- system scope reads nothing, and only the listed system-scope methods, on
-- the system login's pool, read across tenants.
--
-- `tadas` is the login every process used before the three logins existed.
-- It stays in the clause for one release, so the tasks of the release before
-- keep serving while this one rolls out beside them; the release after drops
-- it.
--
-- ALTER, not DROP and CREATE: each table keeps its one policy under its name.
