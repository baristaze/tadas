-- The transitional login is out of the clause. `tadas`, the login every
-- process used before the three logins existed, stayed in the system-scope
-- clause for one release, so the tasks of the release before kept serving
-- while that release rolled out beside them. Those tasks are gone, and the
-- master reaches the database for the migration alone, so the clause names
-- the system login and nothing else.

-- ALTER, not DROP and CREATE: each table keeps its one policy under its name.
