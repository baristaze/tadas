-- The admin role, whole: the operator plane's own tables. The one table is
-- the platform's size as the sweep last counted it: one row, whose id is the
-- empty UUID. Only that count writes the role, so the operator plane's read
-- of it never counts a role the application writes to (ADR 0074). It holds
-- no tenant's row, so it carries no fence.
