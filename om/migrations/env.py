"""Alembic environment: one chain and one version table per role. The role
and the connection come from `config.attributes`, set by
`tadas.om.storage.migrate`; running without either is refused, so a role is
never migrated by accident, and every migration runs on the one connection
the runner opens, under its lock bound (ADR 0071)."""
