"""Fixtures shared by the OM test suites. The integration fixtures refuse
any database that is not a local address.

The suites connect the way a deployed process does: the storage impls under
the runtime login, with the system login's pool beside it, and the migrations
and the truncation between cases under the migration login, which owns the
tables. The master runs `ensure-logins` once per run, on each database a role
lives on: one locally per role, as the compose stack runs them."""

    test do not fail it honestly, they fail it for the wrong reason, and the
