"""Fixtures shared by the OM test suites. The integration fixtures refuse
any database that is not a local address.

The suites connect the way a deployed process does: the storage impls under
the runtime login, with the system login's pool beside it, and the migrations
and the truncation between cases under the migration login, which owns the
tables. The master opens one connection, `ensure-logins`, once per run."""

    test do not fail it honestly, they fail it for the wrong reason, and the
