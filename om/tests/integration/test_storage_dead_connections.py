"""A connection the server closed while it sat in the pool fails no call.

The pool sends no ping before a checkout. A dead connection shows itself on
the transaction's first statement, the scope, which writes nothing, and the
funnel then begins the transaction again on a fresh connection. These cases
close pooled connections from the server side, the way a restart or a
terminated backend does, and then run calls through the funnel. The last one
holds the other half of the rule: once the caller's own statements have run,
nothing is retried.
