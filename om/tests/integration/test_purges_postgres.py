"""The purges and the sweep's requeue of expired leases, held by a live
Postgres: each one's statements are served by an index, and a row another
transaction holds is skipped, not waited on. Every namespace's purge past its
retention runs across tenants in the system scope, each statement on an index
that leads with the retention column; the purge of one tenant past its own
retention reads that tenant's rows by an index that org_id leads.

The plans are read off the statements the storage impls send, captured as
they go to the driver, so what is explained is the purge itself and not a
copy of it. Each is explained with sequential scans switched off: on a
table this small the planner would read the heap whatever indexes exist,
and the question here is whether an index can serve the statement at all.
A predicate no index serves, such as `done_at < x OR failed_at < x` with no
index on `failed_at`, still plans a sequential scan then.

Whether the plan cache keeps an index is a second question, asked of tables
with rows and statistics. The driver prepares each statement once per
connection, and after five runs Postgres may keep a generic plan. So a purge
runs as the sweep runs it, on one connection: a backlog first, then a pass
with nothing to purge, and the plan read is the one that connection holds
for the idle pass. Sequential scans stay on there.
