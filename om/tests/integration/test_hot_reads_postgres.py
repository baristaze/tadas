"""The hot reads, held by a live Postgres: the `mine` scope, the done list and
the archive, the cleanup's read of the archivable tasks, the re-mint's fence,
and the idempotency, invitations, and Slack purges each read the index made
for them.

The plans are read off the statements the storage impls send, captured as
they go to the driver, and explained as the runtime login under the scope the
statement ran in, with row-level security in force. Each is explained twice:
with the values it was sent with, and as the generic plan a prepared statement
reaches after five runs, in which every value is a parameter. A partial index
whose predicate names a bound value serves the first and never the second.

The tenant is seeded with enough rows, across enough people, for the planner
to choose between indexes on statistics, and sequential scans are switched
off, as in the purge suite: the question is which index serves the
statement, not whether a small table is cheaper read whole.
