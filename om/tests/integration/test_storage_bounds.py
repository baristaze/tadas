"""The pool bounds, held by a live Postgres.

The unit suite proves the engine is built with the numbers the settings name.
These cases prove the numbers do what they say on a real connection: every
contract case over Postgres runs under the settings' own deadline, a
statement past its deadline is cancelled by the database, and a checkout past
the pool waits its bound and fails. Through the storage funnel, both leave as
`Unavailable`, on every role and under both logins. The cases after the first
set small bounds of their own, so each answers in a fraction of a second; the
defaults are not changed by anything here.
