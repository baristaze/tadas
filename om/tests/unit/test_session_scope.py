"""Every transaction names its scope at the funnel, and the system scope is
passed only where the enumerated exceptions say.

`PgStorageBase._session_for` is the one place a Postgres impl opens a session,
and it takes the tenant. `EMPTY_UUID` as the tenant is the system scope: the
transaction that reads across tenants, which the policy lets through. That is
the one deliberate bypass, so it is read out of the source here rather than
trusted to review. This walks the syntax, not the call: a method that passes
`EMPTY_UUID` through a variable is not read, which is why the funnel's
argument is spelled at every call site and nowhere computed.
