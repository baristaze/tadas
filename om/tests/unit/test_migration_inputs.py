"""The files that decide what the migrate task does to a database.

The deploy runs the migrate task only when a fingerprint of these files
changes (deployment/migration-inputs.json, read by the environment module).
A file that shapes the migration and is missing from the list would let a
release skip a migration the database lacks, so the list is held here to
the code: every migration file, and every module of this repository the
migrate command imports.
