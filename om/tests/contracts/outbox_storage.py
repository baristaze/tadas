"""The outbox contract, exercised through a core-role write: the row lands
with the user it announces, the sweep claims it across tenants one attempt
at a time, the relay marks it done or records the failure, and the purge
deletes what is settled.

The cases named in `CROSS_TENANT_CASES` are the tenant fence's evidence: each
one presents another tenant's identifier and asserts that nothing is found and
nothing changes. The claim and the purge serve the sweep and take no tenant,
so they are in the enumerated exceptions instead. The negative control that
says what the cases catch is in `docs/runbooks/tenant-isolation.md`."""
