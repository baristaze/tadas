"""A lease kept by the worker that runs its holder's job, and a resource with
as many labels as a real one offers: the cases the memory suite and the
Postgres suite both run, each over its own root, so the job's claim fences
the lease the same way in either. The grant writes the job as a work item in
its own commit; the worker that claims the item starts the lease, renews it,
and ends it, under the item's claim token and the lease's token."""
