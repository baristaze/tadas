// A push is a hint: it names one record, and the version its change wrote
// when the record carries one, and nothing else of it. The reader reads that
// one record through the authorized read and places the answer in the query
// cache; a read that finds nothing removes it. A record the cache already
// holds at that version is not read: the tab that wrote it placed the write's
// answer, and the push is about that answer. Hints that arrive together are
// read together, so a record named twice is read once, and a burst past a
// bound reads the collections once instead of record by record. The reader
// knows no entity: everything it reaches for is handed in, so one reader
// serves any entity with a read of one record, and it runs in a test with
// fake timers and no query cache.
