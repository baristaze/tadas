"""The realtime mode: one channel, every task change told as a line as it
happens. The push says which task changed and who did it; the task itself
is fetched, since a push is a hint and the record is the truth. A deleted
task cannot be fetched, so the listener remembers every task it has seen.
A read that fails is that change's failure, not the stream's: it is told on
stderr, the change is skipped, and the task's next change shows its state.
Only a dead credential (401) ends the listener. When the stream is trimmed
past where the listener stood, the changes between are not told: stderr says
so, the listener reads every task again, and goes on from the stream's head."""
