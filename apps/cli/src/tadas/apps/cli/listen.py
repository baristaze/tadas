"""The realtime mode: one channel, and every change in the org told as one
line as it happens: when, who, what they did, and to which record. The push
carries all of it: its kind names the namespace, the entity, and the action,
and its target is the record's id. The actor's name comes from the org's
members, read once and again when a push names someone new. A read of the
members that fails leaves the actor as someone; only a dead credential (401)
ends the listener. When the stream is trimmed past where the listener stood,
the changes between are not told: stderr says so, and the listener goes on
from the stream's head."""
