"""The request id in the log lines is ambient state, and ambient state is what
the context exists to replace. So the one context variable the platform keeps
is held to a boundary, checked here rather than written down: it is read only
by the sinks that need it for free, and an entry point that sets it gives the
token back in a `finally`, so it never outlives the unit of work.

A static scan of the source files; nothing here imports the modules it reads.
