"""The error tracker never receives a secret: no frame locals, no request
body, no personal data, and a scrubber over what an event still carries. Nor
does it receive what a caller wrote as a request's path, query, or headers.

Nor does it, or a log line, receive an exception's text, which quotes what
the exception was handed: the input a model refused, the row a constraint
refused. What an operator reads of an error is its type, its frames in the
tree's own code, the request id, and the message of a failure the platform
raised, which names a backend, an operation, and a code."""
