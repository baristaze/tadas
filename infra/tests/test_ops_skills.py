"""The ops skills share one preamble, and keep their invariants inline.

The operational detail a reader needs once, and not in every skill, lives
in `.agents/skills/_shared/ops-preamble.md`: the profiles, the account
check, the env file's fields, and the way back when a token expires. A
skill that reaches a cloud environment names that file, by its path from
the skill's own folder, as every agent that reads a skill resolves it.

A rule that must never be missed does not travel by reference, so the
lines that stop a secret leaking stay written in each skill that could
break them, and this test holds them there.
