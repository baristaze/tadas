"""A request's deadline, as every client keeps to it: a call with none waits
for what it waits for; a call that starts with no time left does not start;
a call still waiting at the deadline is cut there; a wait the call can tell
does not fit ends it at once; and each ends in the refusal the caller hands
in, naming why. What the call raises on its own before the deadline stays
its own. Then each AWS call a request makes keeps to it, on the clients the
process opens, whose timeout and retries would have it wait far longer."""
