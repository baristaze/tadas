"""Topics: wake-ups and live updates. Names are fixed by enum, payloads by
the payload map. A topic is best effort: a published event reaches every
process that was subscribed at the time, at most once, and a bus hiccup may
lose it. Durable work never rides a topic; it is a row in the work queue,
and a missed wake-up degrades to polling latency, never to lost work.
`publish` says whether the bus took the message, so a producer that must not
lose one keeps it and sends it again."""
