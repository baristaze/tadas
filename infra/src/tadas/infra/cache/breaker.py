"""The cache breaker: the cost bound in front of a cache that lives out of
process. It is a decoration like every other one here, an impl of
`CacheInterface` holding an inner impl of the same interface, and it changes
when an answer arrives, never what the answer is.

An open breaker answers the way the dependency's own failure answers, because
a caller holding a `CacheInterface` cannot tell what is behind it. A cache
fails open, so here that answer is not an exception: `get` is a miss, `put` and
`invalidate` are dropped, and `increment` is the count no count, which is what
the login rate limit reads as fail open. Each is what the Valkey impl answers
for a backend it cannot reach, given at once and without going out, so nothing
above can tell an open breaker from a backend that is down. Raising the
unavailable shape here would turn a Valkey that is down into a 503 on the login
route, a refusal the caller was written not to get, which is the outage the
miss exists to prevent. The breaker declines to pay the timeout, never to keep
the contract.

A refusal is counted as a refusal and never as a miss, because nothing was
looked up: a miss counted for a lookup that never happened would report the
backend as answering when it was never asked. The hit and miss counters go
quiet while the breaker is open, and the breaker's own counter is what says
why.

`start()` and `close()` are the root's lifecycle and not calls on the
dependency, so they are forwarded whatever the breaker's state is.
