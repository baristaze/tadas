"""A read cache: a projection with a generation, the shape a manager's cached
read takes.

An entry's key is the read's name, the window, and the tenant's generation,
`<name>:<window>:<generation>`, in the scope the manager was handed and under
the tenant the call names, so no tenant reads another's entry. The generation
is a counter in the same scope, one per tenant and window. A write bumps it
with one `increment` once its transaction commits, and every entry cached
before the write is orphaned at once: nothing enumerates a tenant's keys. A
bump before the commit, or inside the transaction, lets a read between the
bump and the commit cache the old value under the new generation.

The TTL is the backstop and the bound on staleness. No entry lives longer, so
a bump that is lost leaves the old entry readable until then, and never
longer.

It fails open, as the cache does. A miss, an entry this build cannot read,
and a cache that cannot be reached are each a read of the source. A cache
that cannot be reached drops the put, so it holds nothing it could serve.
What the caller may see of a value is decided above this, on every call.
