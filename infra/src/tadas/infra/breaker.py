"""The breaker: the bound on what a dependency that is down costs the process
that calls it. A dependency that cannot be reached answers every call with its
whole timeout, and the timeouts alone are what exhaust the pool the calls are
made from. The breaker counts the calls that spend the timeout, refuses at once
for a cool-down once they pass the bound from settings, and then lets one call
through to decide whether to close again.

What it counts is the cost, not the error. A call that fails at once costs its
caller nothing and needs no breaker; a call that spends the timeout is the one
harm this exists to prevent, whatever the impl behind it then returned. So the
signal is the duration of the call against the timeout the client is built
with, which every impl has and none has to report.

The state machine lives here, free of any one capability's interface, and a
decoration over that interface holds it (`cache/breaker.py`). One breaker
stands for one dependency and every impl that talks to that dependency holds
the same instance, so a backend that is down opens it once for all of them
rather than once for each.

Four outcomes are counted under the breaker's subsystem: `opened` when it
opens, `refused` once per call it refuses, `probed` for the one call it lets
through after a cool-down, and `closed` when that call comes back in time.
