"""Feature flags: a capability, as the cache and the secrets are. A flag is
a release toggle or a kill switch, never what a tenant may do: that is a
modelled entity with a manager.

Every flag is declared here, in code, with its default and whether a client
may read it. A provider only overrides a declared flag's value for an
audience, and a flag it does not know, or a provider that fails, reads the
default declared here.

The audience is an org first and, optionally, a person inside it: the
`user_id` of the identity that acts in that org. One call evaluates every
declared flag for one audience, and the precedence is the same in every
impl: a rule on the user, then a rule on the org, then the provider's own
default for the flag, then the code's."""
