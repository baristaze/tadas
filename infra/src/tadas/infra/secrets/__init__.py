"""Secrets: a capability, not a domain. The object model holds references;
the value is resolved at the point of use and discarded. Errors name the
secret and the store, never the value.

A secret belongs to a tenant, as a cache entry and a bucket object do: every
call takes the `org_id` first, and each tenant's secrets sit under a prefix
of their own, so a name one tenant presents never resolves to another
tenant's secret, or to one of the platform's. The platform's own credentials
(the database URL, the error tracker's DSN) are not read through here: they
reach the process at start."""
