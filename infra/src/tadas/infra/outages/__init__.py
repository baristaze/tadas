"""The outage signal: what every process knows of a provider that is failing
for one credential, so that a process reads it before it calls and does not
pay for the outage on its own. It sits beside the breaker. A breaker cuts a
dependency off for the process that holds it; the signal tells every other
process at once.

A mark is keyed by the provider and the credential the call is made with:
the org that holds it (`SYSTEM_SCOPE` for the platform's own) and the
secret's name, never its value. One org's revoked key is no outage of
another's, nor of the platform's. A caller marks the pair when its calls
fail together, with the time to try again, and clears it when a call
succeeds.

One process needs no signal: its own breaker already holds what it learned,
so the null impl never marks. Processes that share a provider share one
signal, on the shared cache, and it fails open as the cache does: a cache
that cannot answer is a pair with no mark, and the provider's own errors
still stop the caller."""
