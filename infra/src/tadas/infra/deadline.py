"""A request's deadline: the instant its time runs out, which every call it
makes to something outside the process shares (ADR 0069).

The gateway stamps it on the request stage, the caller hands it to each
call, and the client that makes the call keeps to it with `bounded`. A call
made with none (a worker's, bounded by its item's lease; a boot's) waits
only for its own timeout and retries.

It is an instant, not a duration, so calls made one after another share
what is left instead of each starting a budget of its own."""
