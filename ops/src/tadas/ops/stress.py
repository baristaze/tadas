"""The stress test: the traffic generator with a scenario. A scenario file
names a profile, a duration, a ramp, and a target (a p95 and an error ratio)
stated before the run. The run ramps the workers up linearly, drives the
profile for the duration, then reads the signals back for the window and
passes or fails against the target. The numbers a system is held to are the
system's, and they live in the scenario file, not here.

The caller may state the target instead, one number or both, and then the
scenario's is a default and not a judgement. Either way the run says which
target it judged and where that number came from: a verdict without that is
a number without a claim."""
