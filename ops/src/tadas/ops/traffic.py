"""The one traffic generator. It drives the edge through the Python client,
never a manager: a session is what a person does in the portal, and a run is
many sessions at once, for a bounded time, at a profile.

A person signs in once, at the start of the run: the local sign-in, by
address alone, then the exchange for a session token in the org. Every
session that person drives reuses that token, and the sign-out comes once,
at the end. The API counts every sign-in against a per-address rate limit,
and a run signs all its people in from one address; a session that signed in
for itself would measure that limit instead of the application. One sign-in
per person leaves little room for a refusal, so a sign-in the rate limit
turns away waits the window out and asks again, a bounded number of times,
and a run that still signs nobody in fails and says why.

The local sign-in is the local stack's alone: a deployed environment signs
people in through the identity provider, in a browser, and answers the
local sign-in with 404. So a run against a deployed environment is refused
before it provisions anything.

A session: open the socket, list the open tasks, add five or six with an
idempotency key each, edit one, complete two, reopen one, move one, list the
done ones, delete one, read the stream after where it stood at the start,
see one of its own changes arrive on the socket. A person thinks between
steps.

The people of an org share its tasks, and a move can renumber every open
task of the org, so a session's write can meet a task that moved on since
it read it. The API answers that with 412, the optimistic-concurrency
refusal, and a session does what a client does: it reads the task afresh
and makes the write once more on the fresh version. A task that is gone,
404 on the write or on the read, is dropped and the session goes on
without it. Both are counted on their own, as conflicts and as tasks gone,
and neither is an error or a failure: they are the API working as it
should under shared work. Every other refusal still fails the session.

The tenants a run needs come from the operator plane (`POST /v1/admin/orgs`,
a grant of Max, and its members) under the provisioner's operator token, a
`write` entry and never a sign-in. They are named for the run, `ops-<run id>-<n>`, so no real
tenant is touched and anything that counts tenants can leave them out, and
the run removes them (`DELETE /v1/admin/orgs/{org_id}`) when it ends, a
failure included; the ones it could not remove are named in the report.
`orgs=0` drives the org and the two people `make seed` created instead, which
is how the local stack is exercised with nothing provisioned."""
