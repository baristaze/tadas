"""The one traffic generator. It drives the edge through the Python client,
never a manager: a session is what a person does in the portal, and a run is
many sessions at once, for a bounded time, at a profile.

A person signs in once, at the start of the run: a login, then the exchange
for a session token in the org. Every session that person drives reuses that
token, and the sign-out comes once, at the end. Sign-in verifies a password
on purpose, so it is the slowest route the generator calls, and the API
counts it against a per-address rate limit; a session that signed in for
itself measured password hashing and that limit instead of the application.

A session: open the socket, list the open tasks, add five or six with an
idempotency key each, edit one, complete two, reopen one, move one, list the
done ones, delete one, read the stream after where it stood at the start,
see one of its own changes arrive on the socket. A person thinks between
steps.

The tenants a run needs come from the operator plane (`POST /v1/admin/orgs`
and its members) under the provisioner's operator token, a `write` entry and
never a password. They are named for the run, `ops-<run id>-<n>`, so no real
tenant is touched and anything that counts tenants can leave them out, and
the run removes them (`DELETE /v1/admin/orgs/{org_id}`) when it ends, a
failure included; the ones it could not remove are named in the report.
`orgs=0` drives the org and the two people `make seed` created instead, which
is how the local stack is exercised with nothing provisioned."""
