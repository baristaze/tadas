"""The Sentry-shaped read both impls share: GlitchTip locally and Sentry in
the cloud answer the same issue and event routes, under a token. There is one
project for the product, and every environment reports into it, so a read
names the project and filters on the environment: `environment:<name>` in the
issue search, and the event's own `environment` tag as the proof. An issue in
a shared project can hold events from more than one environment, which is why
the environment is checked on the event and not only on the issue. The event
that answers is the one whose `request_id` tag is the id the platform put on
every event of that request."""
