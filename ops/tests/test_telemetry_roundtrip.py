"""The telemetry round trip: the API as a real process on a port this run
picks, the devx collector aimed at that port for as long as the run lasts,
the trace exporter and the error tracker set, one session of traffic through
the edge, and then every signal read back by request id through the local
reader: the log line that names it, the counter that moved, the trace that
exists, the error event that carries it.

The error leg is a second process of the same binary on a free port whose
database is unreachable: a route that raises past the gateway is answered
500 with the request id and reported to the tracker, which is the one path
that produces an ERROR without a code change and without harming the session
the other legs read.

Needs the devx profile and a migrated, seeded stack. What is missing is a
skip on a developer's machine, naming it, and a failure wherever
`TADAS_TELEMETRY_REQUIRED` is set: a skipped check in CI is no check."""
