# The audit tools

What the audit skills run. An audit is a read-only analysis that repeats:
after a big change, before a release, when the product grows. It builds
what it measures on its own, writes a report, and proposes tickets; it
never fixes. These tools are the parts of an audit that are the same
every time, so a run is one command and its numbers compare with the
last run's.

They live beside the application, never in it: no process of the
platform imports them. They run from the repository root with `uv run
python ops/audit/<tool>.py`, on the local stack (`make infra-up`, and
`make migrate` once).

| Tool | Does | Used by |
|------|------|---------|
| `auditdb.py create\|drop\|env <name>` | Makes a database named `audit_<slug>` on the local Postgres, gives it the logins' grants, and migrates every role; drops it with its connections. Refuses any other name and any host that is not local. | every database audit |
| `seed.py <name> --scale <n>` | Fills an audit database, as the superuser, with a heavy synthetic shape: at scale 1, 5,000 people with a personal org each, a team org of 200 members holding 100,000 tasks (open, done, archived, deleted) and a million events, and work items, outbox rows, sessions, idempotency records, files, invitations, API keys, Slack installations, and cleanup records beside them. Every count scales linearly; `0.01` is a quick run of the same shape. | `audit-retention`, `audit-query-indexes` |
| `explain.py plans <name> <file>` | `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` of each statement in a file, under the login and scope the storage funnel uses (row-level security in force), each in a transaction it rolls back; the generic plan for a statement given `-- params:`. | `audit-retention`, `audit-query-indexes` |
| `explain.py inventory\|reset\|index\|rows <name>` | Every table's rows and size and every index's size and scans; zeroes the scan counters; creates or drops one candidate index; prints what one `SELECT` returns. | the same |
| `dbcalls.py run\|summary` | The real API and worker in one process over an audit database, with the provider twins, driven through the flows of `dbcalls_flows.py` (and a run's own `--flows` file); counts every round trip, transaction, and role at the asyncpg adapter, and labels each transaction with the storage method that opened it. | `audit-database-calls` |
| `deploy_timeline.py steps\|events` | A deploy run's jobs and its long steps from `gh run view --json`, and a window's ECS service events from `describe-services`, as tables with offsets. | `audit-deploy-time` |

The tests are `ops/tests/test_audit_tools.py` (no database) and
`ops/tests/test_audit_database.py` (`make test-integration`), which
makes, seeds, reads, counts, and drops a database of its own; a schema
change the seed no longer fits fails there.
