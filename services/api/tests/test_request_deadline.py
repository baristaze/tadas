"""A request's deadline (ADR 0069). Admission gives an admitted request one,
counted from when it takes its slot, and every call the request makes to a
provider or to AWS shares it. So a provider that hangs costs the request its
deadline, not its timeouts times its retries: a sign-in through a WorkOS
that never answers is unavailable by then; the three WorkOS calls of an
invitation, each well inside its timeout, share one deadline; and a Slack
install whose token store did not answer in time ends on the settings
page, failed. A scan then holds every manager to handing each such call its
context's deadline."""
