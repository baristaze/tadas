"""A revocation crosses processes: two API containers over the compose
stack's Postgres and Valkey, one serving a socket, the other revoking the
session behind it; the socket closes with 4401 on the wire. When the bus
never carries the message, the serving process's own recheck closes it
within its interval. A change of role closes the socket with 1012. The pong
carries the head heard on the bus, and reads it once that is too old."""
