"""Edge idempotency: a creating POST accepts an Idempotency-Key. The outcome
is recorded per tenant and per user under the key, on the same durable
primitive the queue handlers dedupe on, and replayed on a retry. Only an
outcome a retry cannot change is recorded: a refusal is replayed, a failure,
a 429, and a 402 release the marker so the retry runs again on the same id
(a 429 and a plan's bound are answers about now, not about the request): the
release
keeps the marker with its digest and its id and clears only the attempt, so
a retry after a failure that came once the row had landed finds the row
instead of creating a second one. A key seen with a different request is
refused; a key whose first request is still running is told to wait. The
marker names its attempt: an attempt that ran past the pending lease and
lost the marker to a retry is refused when it finishes or releases, and the
refusal is logged and swallowed here, because the retry owns the marker now
and whatever the slow attempt wrote is the row the retry found. A view that
declares secret fields is stored with them absent: the secret is shown once,
on the first response, and a replay says so."""
