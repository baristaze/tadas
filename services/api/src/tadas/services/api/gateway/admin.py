"""The operator gate: the identity stage the bearer reaches is admitted only
when the identity is an operator, and produces an OperatorContext. Two
credentials reach it: the person's own sign-in, which admits only with a
verified second factor and then only to mint one operator token, and an
operator token, which carries one permission and is what every read and
write on the plane takes. The tenancy manager's `admit_operator` decides;
the gate adds the rules of the edge that name the refusal: an operator with
no second factor enrolled yet reaches the two enrolment routes, a sign-in
with its code reaches the mint, and each is refused on every other route,
by name. No OpContext exists on this path."""
