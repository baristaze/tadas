"""The outbox relay after the answer: a request's writes commit their outbox
rows before it answers, and the relay of those rows (the event, the push, the
queued work) runs once the answer's last byte is sent. Nothing in an answer
comes from the relay, so the caller never waits for it.

The relay holds the rows that name this request's id (`hold`), and the
middleware relays them once the app below returns (`release`). It still runs
inside the request: under its request id, which every log line it writes
carries, and under its server span, as a child span of its own. Each row
carries the request's id and trace context besides, as a handoff does. A
relay that fails is logged and counted and never reaches the caller; the
maintenance sweep relays the rows past its grace. A process stopped between
the answer and the relay leaves the rows to the sweep too, and says how
many."""
