"""Admission: the bounds on what this process has in flight, and the refusal
past them. It is not the rate limit beside it, and the two fail in opposite
directions. A rate limit is fairness between subjects, counted in the shared
cache, and fails open. Admission is this process defending itself, counted
here in its own memory, and fails closed: past a bound a request is refused
at once, so a saturated process answers and says why instead of queueing work
it cannot start and dying with every caller still waiting.

The bound is two bounds, one lane for reads and one for writes, so that a
storm in one lane cannot take every slot from the other: a client back from
an outage replays its backlog with reads, and the commands behind it are
still admitted.

A request admitted also gets its deadline: the instant, counted from when it
takes its slot, that every call it makes outside the process shares (ADR
0069). The count bounds how many requests hold a slot; the deadline bounds how
long a provider that hangs keeps one."""
