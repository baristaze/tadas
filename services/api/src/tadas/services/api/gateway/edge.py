"""The client address through the portal's CDN edge.

The portal reaches the API through its own CDN distribution, which forwards
the request to the load balancer. Each appends the address it received the
request from to X-Forwarded-For: the edge appends the viewer's, the load
balancer appends the edge's. uvicorn walks that header from the right past
the trusted proxies (the load balancer's block) and stops at the edge, so on
its own it names the edge as the client, and every viewer the edge serves
shares one rate-limit subject.

The edge is one hop further in only when the request came through this
system's distribution. Any CDN customer's distribution appends an address,
and its owner can write the header before it, so the edge's address range
proves nothing. The distribution proves itself instead: it sends a secret in
`X-Tadas-Edge` on every request, set whatever the viewer sent under that
name. Beside that secret, and only beside it, this middleware takes the
address the edge appended as the client. Without it, or with a wrong one,
the client stays what uvicorn named. The header is removed from the scope
either way, so nothing further in reads, logs, or echoes it."""
