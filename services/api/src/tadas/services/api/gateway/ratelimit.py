"""Rate limits counted in the shared cache so every replica shares one
budget. Three kinds, each keyed on its own subject, never on a digest of the
bearer:

- A route's budget. The sign-in routes carry `rate_limited("login")`, keyed
  on the client address, since no credential exists yet.
- A credential's budget, reads apart from writes, keyed on the session or
  key id. Every authenticated request spends it, after the credential
  resolves, in one increment.
- An address's budget of failed authentications. Once it is spent, a
  request from that address is refused before the credential is looked up.

The client address is what the proxy handling and the edge middleware settle
on (see `edge.py`); nothing here reads a forwarded header. Every limit fails
open: a cache that cannot count allows the request. They guard against
runaway clients and are not a security boundary (ADR 0059)."""
