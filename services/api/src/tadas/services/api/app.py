    # Middleware, innermost first. CORS is outermost, so every answer a
    # browser gets carries the headers that let it read the body: the request
    # id middleware writes the 500 envelope itself, and outside CORS that
    # envelope, its code, and its request id would be blocked by the browser
    # while a 401 from the same origin came through. A preflight is answered
    # before the request id is minted, which is right: it is not a request of
    # this API and it belongs in neither the access log nor the metrics.
    #
    # Admission goes inside both, and for the same two reasons. Inside CORS,
    # because its refusal is an answer a browser has to read, Retry-After
    # included, and outside CORS the browser would see a network error where
    # the process said "come back". Inside the request id, because a refusal
    # is an answer of this API like any other: it carries the id the caller
    # correlates on, it is counted, and it is in the access log, which is
    # where the operator reads that the process is refusing and how often. A
    # preflight is answered outside it and holds no slot, which is right for
    # the same reason it is not logged. What admission leaves outside itself
    # is only the little the two middlewares above it do, and it takes its
    # lane's bound before routing, the request body, and every dependency:
    # the lane is the method's, which the scope carries this far out.
    # Innermost of all: the relay of a request's outbox rows, once its answer
    # is sent (`gateway/relay.py`). Inside admission, so a relay holds its
    # request's slot; inside the request id, so it runs under the request's
