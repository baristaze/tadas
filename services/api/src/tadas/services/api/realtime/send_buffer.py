"""Per socket: two bounded send lanes and a drainer task that writes them to
the wire. A frame that reports the state of the socket is a control frame and
an event hint is a stream frame; the drainer empties control first, so a
burst of hints never delays the pong that carries the head seq and never
evicts it. When the stream lane is full the oldest stream frame is dropped
and the drop is logged; the client that notices a gap in the stream replays
from storage. Not to be confused with the transactional outbox of the object
model."""
