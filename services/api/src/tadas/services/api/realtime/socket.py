"""The one socket route and the ticket route that opens it. The gateway
redeems the ticket; the handler subscribes to topics on the client's behalf
through the realtime service, moves frames through the bounded send buffer,
and closes the socket when its authority ends: when the credential behind
the ticket is revoked or the membership ends, which the realtime service
hears on the bus; when the handler's own recheck of the credential is
refused, which bounds a revocation the bus never delivered by minutes; and
at the credential's expiry whatever the client does. A change of the
member's role closes the socket too, with a code that asks the client to
reconnect under the rights it has now."""
