"""The keep-alive numbers, pinned with the load balancer idle timeout in
deployment/realtime-timeouts.json; `tests/test_realtime_timeouts.py` holds
each one to that file.

Two pings keep a socket alive, one per direction. The client sends an
application ping every `PING_INTERVAL_SECONDS` from its own timer; the
answer, a pong, carries the tenant's head seq. The server sends a protocol
ping every `SERVER_PING_INTERVAL_SECONDS` and closes the socket when no
pong arrives within `SERVER_PING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; that pong is answered
by the client's socket implementation (a browser answers it whatever the
tab's timers do), so a background tab whose timers are throttled keeps its
socket open and only its head-seq check slows down. The interval plus the
timeout stays below the load balancer's idle timeout, so the server, not
the load balancer, is what ends a dead socket."""
