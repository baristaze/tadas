"""Inbound calls from providers, outside /v1: the version of their shape is
the provider's. A route takes no credential and no rate limit; it is
authenticated by the provider's signature over the body and its timestamp,
checked before anything is queued, and a worker does what the call means.

The identity provider delivers its events to `/webhooks/identity`."""
