"""The identity provider: the hosted service that proves who a person is.
It hands Tadas an issuer, a subject, and a verified email; the identity row,
the sessions, and every id stay Tadas's own. It also holds the provider's
side of an org (its organization, its single sign-on, its invitations),
which the tenancy manager creates lazily and names by the Tadas org's id.

One interface, a real client (`workos.py`), a deterministic twin
(`twin.py`), and the absent provider (`absent.py`) of a process that signs
nobody in, such as the worker.

A call a request makes carries the request's `deadline`, the instant its
time runs out, which every call it makes shares (ADR 0069). The call ends by
then, `ProviderUnavailable`, as when the provider does not answer. The two
deletions are a worker's, bounded by the item's lease, and take none."""
