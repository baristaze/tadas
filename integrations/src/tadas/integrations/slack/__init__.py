"""Slack: the one interface the platform reaches Slack through, and the errors
a caller decides on.

Tadas is a distributed Slack app. Each org installs it into its own
workspace through OAuth v2, and the install hands back a bot token for that
workspace alone; every Web API call here names the token it is made under.
Slack's calls in (slash commands, events) are signed with the app's signing
secret, and `verify_request` checks one before anything reads it. The app's
client id, client secret, and signing secret are this process's; a
workspace's token is its tenant's, and the caller resolves it.

The real client speaks the Web API; the twin answers in-process, issues its
own installs and tokens, and signs its own requests with Slack's scheme. A
caller never knows which it holds.

The errors are the decision a caller needs, not Slack's whole vocabulary: a
rate limit says when to come back, an unusable channel says the channel is
broken until a person fixes it, a revoked token says the install is gone,
and anything else is a failure worth a retry.

A call a request makes (the install's exchange, an uninstall, a revoke)
carries the request's `deadline`, which every call it makes shares (ADR
0069), and ends by then, `SlackFailed`, as when Slack does not answer. The
rest are a worker's, bounded by the item's lease."""
