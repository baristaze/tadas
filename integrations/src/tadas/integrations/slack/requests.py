"""A call in from Slack: its signature, what it carries, and its key.

Slack signs `v0:<timestamp>:<raw body>` with HMAC-SHA256 under the app's
signing secret and sends `v0=<hex>` in `X-Slack-Signature`, with the
timestamp in `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp`. The check is the SDK's own, over
the raw bytes, compared in constant time, and refuses a timestamp more than
five minutes from now. The twin signs with `sign`, written here from Slack's
documented scheme and never from the SDK, so a test that passes proves the
two agree.

A verified call becomes an `SlackInbound`: what the API puts on the `slack`
queue and the worker takes off it. Its key is the producer's idempotency key,
a UUID v5 over the provider's name and the delivery's own id: an event's
`event_id`, which Slack keeps across its retries, and a command's
`trigger_id`, which names one invocation."""
