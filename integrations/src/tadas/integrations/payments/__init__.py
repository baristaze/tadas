"""Payments: the processor that owns money, customers, and subscriptions.

Tadas owns what a plan entitles an org to; the processor owns whether the
org has paid. This interface is the one door to it: a customer per org, a
checkout that starts a subscription, the processor's own page for payment
methods, invoices, and plan changes, the two changes Tadas makes to a
subscription itself (cancel at the period's end, the seat count), the end
of both when an account is deleted (the subscription canceled at once, the
customer deleted), a read of a subscription as the processor holds it now,
and the check of an inbound delivery's signature. It has a real client and a deterministic
twin; the twin refuses to run outside a local environment.

Every call fails by whose problem it is. A refusal of the request itself
is `PaymentsRefused`: the same request gets the same answer. A refusal
of the process's own key (revoked, or without the permission) is
`PaymentsKeyRefused`, a `ProviderUnavailable`: nothing is wrong with the
call, and it goes through once a person fixes the key. A processor that
throttles, or does not answer, is unavailable too.

A call a request makes (the customer, the checkout, the portal, the cancel
and its undo) carries the request's `deadline`, which every call it makes
shares (ADR 0069), and ends by then, unavailable, as when the processor does
not answer. The rest are a worker's, bounded by the item's lease."""
