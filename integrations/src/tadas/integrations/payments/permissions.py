"""The two restricted keys Tadas holds for the payment processor, and what
each may touch, named as Stripe's restricted-key editor names them.

The runtime key serves the API and the worker, from the environment's
secret store. The bootstrap key is held by the person who runs
`tadas-ops stripe-bootstrap`, from their shell, and never reaches the
cloud. Every other resource of either key stays None.
docs/runbooks/providers/stripe.md carries the same two tables for the
person who makes the keys."""
