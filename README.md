# Tadas

Tadas is the domain-agnostic core of a multi-tenant system, in the shape
the Software Design and Architecture Guidelines prescribe
([the pin](specs/architecture.md)). It holds what every product needs
before its first domain screen: tenancy with an operator plane, events
and audit, the outbox, idempotency, the work queue, orchestrations, and
files. A product renames it and builds its domain on top.

## Quick start

Requirements: uv, Node (see `.nvmrc`), and Docker. `make setup`
installs pnpm, at the version `package.json` names, when it is missing.

```bash
make up       # the whole stack in containers, migrated and seeded; prints the URLs
make stop     # pause it: the ports free up, the containers and the data stay
make start    # resume it, with no build, migration, or seed; `make up` on a new tree
make down     # remove the containers; the data stays
make reset    # wipe the data and the containers, then `make up`
make urls     # print the URLs and the sign-ins again
```

| What | URL | Sign-in |
|------|-----|---------|
| Portal | <http://localhost:55173> | `/login/dev` as `owner@example.test` or `bob@example.test` (Ajax), or `admin@admin.test` (Fabrikam, and admin of Ajax). `/login` needs `TADAS_WORKOS_API_KEY`. |
| API | <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs> | none |
| pgweb | <http://localhost:58081> | none |
| Valkey Admin | <http://localhost:58080> | none; host `valkey`, port `6379` |
| ElasticMQ UI | <http://localhost:53000> | none |
| Grafana | <http://localhost:53001> | none |
| Prometheus | <http://localhost:59090> | none |
| Jaeger | <http://localhost:56686> | none |
| GlitchTip | <http://localhost:58000> | `admin@example.test` / `tadas-local` |
| MinIO console | <http://localhost:59001> | `tadas` / `tadas-minio-local` |

Every host port is a knob in `.env.example`; set it in `.env` when a
port is taken.

## Set up and check

```bash
make setup             # Python and TypeScript dependencies
make infra-up          # Postgres (one per database role), Valkey, ElasticMQ, and MinIO alone
make migrate           # the database logins, then every role's migration chain
make seed              # the two orgs, their people, and the local operators
make check             # lint, format, types, arch-check, unit tests
make migrate-check     # every role's ORM metadata against the migrated schema
make test-integration  # the storage contracts over Postgres
```

`scripts/dev.sh` runs the API, the worker, and the portal on the host
with hot reload. A variable exported in the shell wins over `.env`, so
a second checkout points all eight database URLs at a database of
its own: the four shared `TADAS_DATABASE_*` URLs and the four
`TADAS_DATABASE_URL_<ROLE>`, since a role's own URL wins. [deployment/local/README.md](deployment/local/README.md)
works on one service at a time.

## Deploy and operate

`main` is staging and `release` is production. A merge to `main`
deploys staging. A person fast-forwards `release` and approves the
production plan. [The deploy runbook](docs/runbooks/deploy.md) has the
steps and the rollback. A deployed environment has no seed: a person
signs in through WorkOS, and a first sign-in is the sign-up.

Each operational task is a skill a person runs with an agent, and the
credential the skill holds is its boundary. [ops/README.md](ops/README.md)
names the roles, the skills, and the audits.
[The runbooks](docs/runbooks/README.md) hold the procedures a person
follows by hand.

## Layout

- [om/](om/README.md): the object model: namespaces, storage, migrations.
- [infra/](infra/README.md): cache, buckets, topics, queues, secrets, flags, observability.
- [integrations/](integrations/README.md): the identity provider, its twin, and the webhook check.
- [services/api/](services/api/README.md): the API, its gateway, and the realtime socket.
- [workers/maintenance/](workers/maintenance/README.md): the work queue's worker and the sweep.
- `apps/`: the [portal](apps/portal/README.md), the [CLI](apps/cli/README.md), and the
  [company site](apps/site/README.md).
- `clients/`: [typescript/](clients/typescript/README.md), the one client every browser
  app imports, and [python/](clients/python/README.md), the one Python client.
- [deployment/](deployment/README.md): compose, images, and Terraform.
- [ops/](ops/README.md): the operators' package, skills, and stress scenarios.
- `docs/adr/`: the decisions; [specs/architecture.md](specs/architecture.md) pins the
  guideline and lists the deviations.
- [llms.txt](llms.txt): the knowledge map.
